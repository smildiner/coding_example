A Bayesian multilevel hidden Markov model with Poisson-lognormal emissions for intense longitudinal count data". A non-peer-reviewed preprint will be made available soon. Abstract:Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are probabilistic methods in which observations are seen as realizations of a latent Markov process with discrete states that switch over time. Moving beyond standard statistical tests, HMMs offer a statistical environment to optimally exploit the information present in multivariate time series, uncovering the latent dynamics that rule them. Here, we extend the Poisson HMM to the multilevel framework, accommodating variability between individuals with continuously distributed individual random effects following a lognormal distribution, and describe how to estimate the model in a fully parametric Bayesian framework.  The proposed multilevel HMM enables probabilistic decoding of hidden state sequences from multivariate count time-series based on individual-specific parameters, and offers a framework to quantificate between-individual variability formally.  Through a Monte Carlo study we show that the multilevel HMM outperforms the HMM for scenarios involving heterogeneity between individuals, demonstrating improved decoding accuracy and estimation performance of parameters of the emission distribution, and performs equally well when not between heterogeneity is present. Finally, we illustrate how to use our model to explore the latent dynamics governing complex multivariate count data in an empirical application concerning pilot whale diving behaviour in the wild, and how to identify neural states from multi-electrode recordings of motor neural cortex activity in a macaque monkey in an experimental set up. We make the multilevel HMM introduced in this study publicly available in the R-package {\textbackslash}verb{\textbar}mHMMbayes{\textbar} in CRAN.Contents:This repository contains the R code to perform a small Monte Carlo simulation with the multilevel hidden Markov model here presented, along with two empirical applications, and their corresponding data sets.

	abstract = {Societally important decadal predictions of temperature and precipitation over Europe are largely affected by variability in the North Atlantic Ocean. Within this region, the Labrador Sea is of particular importance because of its link between surface-driven density variability and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. Using physical justifications, we propose a statistical model to describe the temporal variability of ocean density in terms of salinity-driven and temperature-driven density. This is a hidden semi-Markov model that allows for either a salinity-driven or a temperature-driven ocean density regime, such that the persistence in each regime is governed probabilistically by a semi-Markov chain. The model is fitted in the Bayesian framework, and a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed to deal with a single-regime scenario. The model is first applied to a reanalysis data set, where model checking measures are also proposed. Then it is applied to data from 43 climate models to investigate whether and how ocean density variability differs between them and also the reanalysis data. Parameter estimates relating to the mean holding time for each regime are used to establish a link between regime behaviour and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.},

	abstract = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are flexible, well-established models useful in a diverse range of applica-tions. However, one potential limitation of such models lies in their inability to explicitly structure the holding times of each hidden state. Hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs) are more useful in the latter respect as they incorporate addi-tional temporal structure by explicit modelling of the hold-ing times. However, HSMMs have generally received less attention in the literature, mainly due to their intensive com-putational requirements. Here a Bayesian implementation of HSMMs is presented. Recursive algorithms are proposed in conjunction with Metropolis-Hastings in such a way as to avoid sampling from the distribution of the hidden state se-quence in the MCMC sampler. This provides a computation-ally tractable estimation framework for HSMMs avoiding the limitations associated with the conventional EM algo-rithm regarding model flexibility. Performance of the pro-posed implementation is demonstrated through simulation experiments as well as an illustrative application relating to recurrent failures in a network of underground water pipes where random effects are also included into the HSMM to allow for pipe heterogeneity.},

Each state has variable duration and a number of observations being produced while in the state. This makes it suitable for use in a wider range of applications. Its forward-backward algorithms can be used to estimate/update the model parameters, determine the predicted, filtered and smoothed probabilities, evaluate goodness of an observation sequence fitting to the model, and find the best state sequence of the underlying stochastic process. Since the HSMM was initially introduced in 1980 for machine recognition of speech, it has been applied in thirty scientific and engineering areas, such as speech recognition/synthesis, human activity recognition/prediction, handwriting recognition, functional MRI brain mapping, and network anomaly detection. There are about three hundred papers published in the literature. An overview of HSMMs is presented in this paper, including modelling, inference, estimation, implementation and applications. It first provides a unified description of various HSMMs and discusses the general issues behind them. The boundary conditions of HSMM are extended. Then the conventional models, including the explicit duration, variable transition, and residential time of HSMM, are discussed. Various duration distributions and observation models are presented.

An HMP is a discrete-time finite-state homogeneous Markov chain observed through a discrete-time memoryless invariant channel. In recent years, the work of Baum and Petrie on finite-state finite-alphabet HMPs was expanded to HMPs with finite as well as continuous state spaces and a general alphabet. In particular, statistical properties and ergodic theorems for relative entropy densities of HMPs were developed. Consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum-likelihood (ML) parameter estimator were proved under some mild conditions. Similar results were established for switching autoregressive processes. These processes generalize HMPs. New algorithms were developed for estimating the state, parameter, and order of an HMP, for universal coding and classification of HMPs, and for universal decoding of hidden Markov channels. These and other related topics are reviewed in this paper.},

Some MCMC methods used in practice (for computing likelihood, conditional probabilities of hidden states, and the most likely sequence of states) can be improved by incorporating established recursive algorithms. The most important of these is a set of forward-backward recursions calculating conditional distributions of the hidden states given observed data and model parameters. I show how to use the recursive algorithms in an MCMC context and demonstrate mathematical and empirical results showing a Gibbs sampler using the forward-backward recursions mixes more rapidly than another sampler often used for HMMs. I introduce an augmented variables technique for obtaining unique state labels in HMMs and finite mixture models. I show how recursive computing allows the statistically efficient use of MCMC output when estimating the hidden states. I directly calculate the posterior distribution of the hidden chain's state-space size by MCMC, circumventing asymptotic arguments underlying the Bayesian information criterion, which is shown to be inappropriate for a frequently analyzed dataset in the HMM literature. The use of log-likelihood for assessing MCMC convergence is illustrated, and posterior predictive checks are used to investigate application specific questions of model adequacy.},

Here, an extended correlation coefficient that applies to K-categories is proposed, and this measure is shown to be highly applicable for evaluating prediction of RNA secondary structure in cases where some predicted pairs go into the category "unknown" due to lack of reliability in predicted pairs or unpaired residues. Hence, predicting base pairs of RNA secondary structure can be a three-category problem. The measure is further shown to be well in agreement with existing performance measures used for ranking protein secondary structure predictions.

Under certain conditions overreporting may also occur.When statistical output on changes is estimated from decentralised administrative data, the question may arise whether those changes are affected by shifts in reporting frequencies. For instance, in a case study on hospital data, the values from certain data suppliers may have been affected by changes in reporting frequencies. We present an automatic procedure to detect suspicious data suppliers in decentralised administrative data in which shifts in reporting behaviour are likely to have affected the estimated output. The procedure is based on a predictive mean matching approach, where part of the original data values are replaced by imputed values obtained from a selected reference group.

	abstract = {Time series clustering algorithms have been widely used to mine the
clustering distribution characteristics of real phenomena. However,
these algorithms have several limitations. First, they depend heavily on
prior knowledge. Second, the algorithms do not simultaneously consider
the similarity of spatial locations, spatial-temporal attribute values,
and spatial-temporal attribute trends ( trends in terms of the change
direction and ranges in addition and deletion over time), which are all
important similarity measurements. Finally, the calculation cost based
on these methods for clustering analysis is becoming increasingly
computationally demanding, because the data volume of the image time
series data is increasing. In view of these shortcomings, an improved
density-based time series clustering method based on image resampling (
DBTSC-IR) has been proposed in this paper. The proposed DBTSC-IR has two
major parts. In the first part, an optimal resampling scale of the image
time series data is first determined to reduce the data volume by using
a new scale optimization function. In the second part, the traditional
density-based time series clustering algorithm is improved by
introducing a density indicator to control the clustering sequences by
considering the spatial locations, spatial-temporal attribute values,
and spatial-temporal attribute trends. The final clustering analysis is
then performed directly on the resampled image time series data by using
the improved algorithm. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed
DBTSC-IR is illustrated by experiments on both the simulated datasets
and in real applications. The proposed method can effectively and
adaptively recognize the spatial patterns with arbitrary shapes of image
time series data with consideration of the effects of noise.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jprot.2013.02.019},
	abstract = {Prediction of protein sub-cellular localisation by employing quantitative mass spectrometry experiments is an expanding field. Several methods have led to the assignment of proteins to specific subcellular localisations by partial separation of organelles across a fractionation scheme coupled with computational analysis.Methods developed to analyse organelle data have largely employed supervised machine learning algorithms to map unannotated abundance profiles to known protein-organelle associations. Such approaches are likely to make association errors if organelle-related groupings present in experimental output are not included in data used to create a protein-organelle classifier. Currently, there is no automated way to detect organelle-specific clusters within such datasets.In order to address the above issues we adapted a phenotype discovery algorithm, originally created to filter image-based output for RNAi screens, to identify putative subcellular groupings in organelle proteomics experiments. We were able to mine datasets to a deeper level and extract interesting phenotype clusters for more comprehensive evaluation in an unbiased fashion upon application of this approach. Organelle-related protein clusters were identified beyond those sufficiently annotated for use as training data. Furthermore, we propose avenues for the incorporation of observations made into general practice for the classification of protein-organelle membership from quantitative MS experiments. Biological significance: Protein sub-cellular localisation plays an important role in molecular interactions, signalling and transport mechanisms. The prediction of protein localisation by quantitative mass-spectrometry (MS) proteomics is a growing field and an important endeavour in improving protein annotation. Several such approaches use gradient-based separation of cellular organelle content to measure relative protein abundance across distinct gradient fractions. The distribution profiles are commonly mapped in silico to known protein-organelle associations via supervised machine learning algorithms, to create classifiers that associate unannotated proteins to specific organelles. These strategies are prone to error, however, if organelle-related groupings present in experimental output are not represented, for example owing to the lack of existing annotation, when creating the protein-organelle mapping. Here, the application of a phenotype discovery approach to LOPIT gradient-based MS data identifies candidate organelle phenotypes for further evaluation in an unbiased fashion. Software implementation and usage guidelines are provided for application to wider protein-organelle association experiments. In the wider context, semi-supervised organelle discovery is discussed as a paradigm with which to generate new protein annotations from MS-based organelle proteomics experiments.

	abstract = {For many KDD applications, such as detecting criminal activities in E-commerce, finding the rare instances or the outliers, can be more interesting than finding the common patterns. Existing work in out- lier detection regards being an outlier as a binary property. In this paper, we contend that for many scenarios, it is more meaningful to assign to each object a degree of being an outlier. This degree is called the local outlier factor (LOF) of an object. It is local in that the degree depends on how isolated the object is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood. We give a detailed formal analysis showing that LOF enjoys many desirable properties. Using real- world datasets, we demonstrate that LOF can be used to find outliers which appear to be meaningful, but can otherwise not be identified with existing approaches. Finally, a careful performance evaluation of our algorithm confirms we show that our approach of finding lo- cal outliers can be practical.},

DESIGN: A pooled time-series study of unintentional firearm mortality among children from 1979 through 1997. Setting. The 50 states and the District of Columbia. PARTICIPANTS: All children {\textless}15 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of unintentional deaths attributable to firearms. RESULTS: When the effects of all 15 state CAP laws enacted before 1998 were aggregated, the laws were associated with a 17\% decline unintentional firearm death rates among children. The laws' effects were not equal across states. Florida's CAP law was associated with a 51\% decline; however, there were no statistically significant aggregate or state-specific law effects in the other 14 states with CAP laws. CONCLUSIONS: Florida's CAP law-1 of only 3 such laws allowing felony prosecution of violators-appears to have significantly reduced unintentional firearm deaths to children. However, there is no evidence of effects in the other 14 states with CAP laws.},

We propose three methods for automatic coding: combining separate models for the detailed occupation codes and for aggregate occupation codes, a hybrid method that combines a duplicate-based approach with a statistical learning algorithm, and a modified nearest neighbor approach. Using data from the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS), we show that the proposed methods improve on both the coding accuracy of the underlying statistical learning algorithm and the coding accuracy of duplicates where duplicates exist. Further, we find defining duplicates based on ngram variables (a concept from text mining) is preferable to one based on exact string matches.},

The verbal behaviors of immediately preceding interviewer and respondent turns of speech were assessed in terms of their co-occurrence with each respondent retrieval strategy. Interviewers’ use of parallel probes is associated with poorer data quality, whereas interviewers’ use of timing and duration probes, especially in tandem, is associated with better data quality. Respondents’ use of timing and duration strategies is also associated with better data quality and both strategies are facilitated by interviewer timing probes.

	abstract = {Summary Report of the AAPOR Task Force on Non-probability Sampling Reg Baker, J. Michael Brick*, Nancy A. Bates, Mike Battaglia, Mick P. Couper, Jill A. Dever, Krista J. Gile and Roger Tourangeau ↵*Address correspondence to J. Michael Brick, 1600 Research Blvd, Rockville, MD 20850, USA; E-mail: mikebrick@westat.com. Joseph Sedransk served as the Editor for this report, the comments, and the rejoinder since Roger Tourangeau was a member of the Task Force. Next Section 1. INTRODUCTION Survey researchers routinely conduct studies that use different methods of data collection and inference. But for at least the past 60 years, the probability-sampling framework has been used in most surveys. More recently, concerns about coverage and nonresponse coupled with rising costs have led some to wonder whether non-probability sampling methods might be an acceptable alternative, at least under some conditions (Groves 2006; Savage and Burrows 2007). A wide range of non-probability designs exist and are being used in various settings, including case control studies, clinical trials, evaluation research designs, intercept surveys, and opt-in panels. Generally speaking, these designs have not been explored in detail by survey researchers even though they are frequently used in other applied research fields. Because of their limited use in surveys, the assumptions required to make valid inferences from non-probability samples are not well understood by survey researchers. In fall 2011, the American Association of Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) Executive Council appointed a task force “to examine the conditions under which various survey designs that do not use probability samples might still be useful for making inferences to a larger population.” This article summarizes the efforts of the task force. The full report of the task force (with an extended list of references that we found valuable during review) can be downloaded from the AAPOR website (www.aapor.org). One of the first issues the task force faced was coming to grips with “statistical inference” because this phrase has many meanings and implications. Our task force defined it as a set of procedures that produces estimates about the characteristics of a target population and provides some measure of the reliability of those estimates. A key feature of statistical inference is that it requires some theoretical basis and explicit set of assumptions for making the estimates and for judging the accuracy of those estimates. We consider methods for collecting data and producing estimates without a theoretical basis as not being appropriate for making statistical inferences. With the assent of the AAPOR Executive Council, we also decided not to focus on comparisons between probability and non-probability methods, nor do we contrast the strengths and weaknesses of each. Furthermore, we explicitly avoided exploring probability sampling methods under less than ideal conditions and comparing estimates from probability and non-probability samples. We realize there is considerable interest in whether a probability sample is still a probability sample when it has low coverage or high nonresponse, but the task force has not attempted to undertake this controversial and substantial task. What we have done is examine the strengths and weaknesses of various non-probability methods, considering the theoretical and (to some extent) empirical evidence. We do not claim to have produced an exhaustive study of all possible methods or fully examined all of the literature on any one of them. However, we believe that we have at least identified the most prominent methods and examined them in a balanced and objective way. Non-probability sampling has become especially prevalent as more and more surveys have moved online. More often than not, the primary sample source for online research is a panel of individuals who have been recruited in advance and have agreed to do surveys. We use the term opt-in panel to mean an online panel not recruited via probability sampling. The sampling approaches used with these panels vary substantially. In recent years, researchers working with opt-in panels have begun to explore sampling techniques that go beyond simple quota sampling. The key point is that opt-in panels are not based on a single sampling method but rely on myriad varied sampling methods. Evaluations of survey results that use them should focus more on the sampling method than the mere fact that they come from opt-in panels. Finally, we recognize that for many the phrases “scientific survey” and “probability sampling” are nearly synonymous. Although many members of this task force came into this effort with this perspective, we attempted to be open-minded and fair in our review. This review is unlikely to change the opinions of those who firmly hold that statistical inference is impossible without probability sampling or that the sampling method is irrelevant to inference. In this regard, readers might do well to recall these words from Kish (1965, pp. 28–29): Great advances of the most successful sciences—astronomy, physics, chemistry—were, and are, achieved without probability sampling. Statistical inference in these researches is based on subjective judgment about the presence of adequate, automatic, and natural randomization in the population … No clear rule exists for deciding exactly when probability sampling is necessary, and what price should be paid for it … Probability sampling for randomization is not a dogma, but a strategy, especially for large numbers. As the task force reviewed the field and began to prepare its findings, we did not seek a “clear rule” mentioned by Kish. Rather, we hope our findings are a first step that stimulates a broader debate across the survey research profession. We think such a debate is much needed, if not overdue, as we face the challenge of adapting our methods to an already changed and continually evolving world. It is not the first such challenge in the long history of survey research, nor will it be the last. As has always been the case, the profession will be stronger by taking it on. Previous Section Next Section 2. BACKGROUND The principal goal of survey sampling is to make reliable and accurate inferences to a broader population. For many decades, survey researchers have relied on the probability sampling paradigm as the basis for those inferences, but it has by no means been the only paradigm, nor has it always been dominant (e.g., Frankel and Frankel 1987; Brick 2011). While official statistics largely adopted probability sampling beginning in the late 1930s, this paradigm did not fully enter the public polling realm until after the two spectacular public failures of non-probability based surveys in the U.S. presidential elections of 1936 and 1948. Even then, non-probability sampling continued to be used alongside probability-based methods for several more decades, especially in market research and academia, where it continues to this day. Historically, the main arguments advanced against probability-based samples have been those of cost and time efficiency. This was an easy argument to make when the most common survey mode was face-to-face interviewing. The emergence of random digit dial (RDD) telephone surveys heralded a broad expansion of probability sampling in political polling, market research, and academia (Glasser and Metzger 1972). Recently, the rapid rise in cell phone–only households raised concerns about coverage bias (Lavrakas et al. 2007) and the long-term decline in response rates raised questions about nonresponse bias (Curtin, Presser, and Singer 2005). At about that same time, the rapid increase in Internet penetration created expectations about the potential benefits of online surveys. The inability to develop RDD-like methods to sample and recruit respondents online led to the development of alternative approaches relying on non-probability methods, most notably opt-in panels comprised of volunteers. But as the AAPOR Task Force on Online Panels (Baker et al. 2010) noted, such surveys have value for some types of research, but researchers “should avoid non-probability opt-in panels when a key research objective is to accurately estimate population values … [and] claims of ‘representativeness’ should be avoided when using these sample sources.” So the survey profession once again faces a significant challenge. The traditional practice of probability sampling, in which good coverage of the general population and high response rates are seen as essential to minimizing inferential risk, is now more difficult and costly to achieve, so much so that the method may only be feasible for very well-funded and socially important surveys, such as those done by national statistical agencies. This has created the opportunity to consider non-probability methods in which auxiliary variables and models are critical to the goal of making valid inferences possible. The key issue is risk. Probability sampling approaches, while using models to adjust for undercoverage and nonresponse, provide some protection against the risk of substantial biases. Non-probability approaches rely more heavily on the appropriateness of the models and, in most cases, on the selection, availability, and quality of the variables used for respondent selection and post hoc adjustment. Previous Section Next Section 3. INTRODUCTION TO NON-PROBABILITY SAMPLING Unlike probability sampling, which has a unified framework for sampling and making inferences to a population, no single framework encompasses all forms of non-probability sampling. Rather, there is a broad range of sampling methods, some of which are complex and sophisticated whereas others are simple and straightforward. Because of the task force's definition of statistical inference, we considered methods for collecting data and producing estimates without a theoretical basis as not being appropriate for making sta},

The second era (1960–1990) witnessed a vast growth in the use of the survey method. This growth was aided by the needs of the U.S. federal government to monitor the effects of investments in human and physical infrastructure, the growth of the quantitative social sciences, and the use of quantitative information to study consumer behaviors.

The results provide direction for improvements in reporting procedures and the basis for a conceptual model of reporting differences.

This paper presents a data processing system to analyze energy consumption patterns in industrial parks, based on the cascade application of a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and the clustering k-means algorithm. The system is validated with real load data from an industrial park in Spain. The validation results show that the system adequately finds different behavior patterns which are meaningful, and is capable of doing so without supervision, and without any prior knowledge about the data.},

The main objective here is to base the investigation on comparing the efficacy of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique with the newly emerging techniques of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and its OS-ELM variant as means of classification and prediction in this context. Non-technical Losses (NTL) represent a significant proportion of electricity losses in both developing and developed countries. The ELM-based approach presented here uses customer load-profile information to expose abnormal behaviour that is known to be highly correlated with NTL activities. This approach provides a method of data mining for this purpose and it involves extracting patterns of customer behaviour from historical kWh consumption data. The results yield classification classes that are used to reveal whether any significant behaviour that emerges are due to irregularities in consumption. In this paper, ELM and online sequential-ELM (OS-ELM) algorithms are both used to achieve an improved classification performance and to increase accuracy of results. A comparison of this approach with other classification techniques, such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, is also undertaken and the ELM performance and accuracy in NTL analysis is shown to be superior.},

In LP multiclass discrimination, a single linear program is used to construct a piecewise-linear classification function. In our proposed multiclass SVM method, a single quadratic program is used to construct a piecewise-nonlinear classification function. Each piece of this function can take the form of a polynomial, a radial basis function, or even a neural network. For the k {\textgreater} 2-class problems, the SVM method as originally proposed required the construction of a two-class SVM to separate each class from the remaining classes. Similarily, k two-class linear programs can be used for the multiclass problem. We performed an empirical study of the original LP method, the proposed k LP method, the proposed single QP method and the original k QP methods.

Our technique is computationally efficient and straightforward to implement. We demonstrate empirically its effectiveness, not only for choosing the number of clusters, but also for identifying underlying structure, on a wide range of simulated and real world datasets. In addition, we give a rigorous theoretical justification for the method based on information-theoretic ideas. Specifically, results from the subfield of electrical engineering known as rate distortion theory allow us to describe the behavior of the distortion in both the presence and absence of clustering. Finally, we note that these ideas potentially can be extended to a wide range of other statistical model selection problems.},

As we remarked before, this process often generates tables of distances with even more numbers than the original data, but we will show now how this in fact simplifies our understanding of the data. Distances between objects can be visualized in many simple and evocative ways. In this chapter we shall consider a graphical representation of a matrix of distances which is perhaps the easiest to understand – a dendrogram, or tree – where the objects are joined together in a hierarchical fashion from the closest, that is most similar, to the furthest apart, that is the most different. The method of hierarchical cluster analysis is best explained by describing the algorithm, or set of instructions, which creates the dendrogram results. In this chapter we demonstrate hierarchical clustering on a small example and then list the different variants of the method that are possible.},

In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

	abstract = {Several application domains such as molecular biology and geography produce a tremendous amount of data which can no longer be managed without the help of efficient and ef- fective data mining methods. One of the primary data min- ing tasks is clustering. However, traditional clustering algo- rithms often fail to detect meaningful clusters because most real-world data sets are characterized by a high dimensional, inherently sparse data space. Nevertheless, the data sets often contain interesting clusters which are hidden in vari- ous subspaces of the original feature space. Therefore, the concept of subspace clustering has recently been addressed, which aims at automatically identifying subspaces of the fea- ture space in which clusters exist. In this paper, we introduce SUBCLU (density-connected Subspace Clustering), an effec- tive and efficient approach to the subspace clustering prob- lem. Using the concept of density-connectivity underlying the algorithm DBSCAN [EKSX96], SUBCLU is based on a formal clustering notion. In contrast to existing grid-based approaches, SUBCLU is able to detect arbitrarily shaped and positioned clusters in subspaces. The monotonicity of density-connectivity is used to efficiently prune subspaces in the process of generating all clusters in a bottom up way. While not examining any unnecessary subspaces, SUBCLU delivers for each subspace the same clusters DBSCAN would have found, when applied to this subspace separately.},

Both require just one DBSCAN–like parameter. Still they perform well on benchmark data sets. Our first approach just uses a parameter similar to DBSCAN's minPts parameter that is used to incrementally find protoclusters which are eventually merged while discarding those that are too sparse. Our second approach only uses a local density without any minimum number of points to be specified. It estimates clusters by seeing them from spectators watching the data points at different angles.

	abstract = {This chapter presents the GPU implementation of the support vector machine (SVM). The SVM is a set of supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, the SVM algorithm builds a model that predicts the class of new unseen examples. This algorithm is considered essential in both machine-learning and data-mining curriculums and is frequently used by practitioners. Besides, its utilization spans to a wide variety of applied research fields such as computer vision, neuroscience, text categorization, and finance. The success of SVMs solving classification tasks in a wide variety of fields, such as text or image processing and medical informatics, has stimulated practitioners to do research on the execution performance and scalability of the training phase of serial versions of the algorithm. Nevertheless, the training phase of the SVM remains a computationally expensive task, and the training time of a binary problem composed by 100,000 points with hundreds of dimensions can often take on the order of hours of serial execution. This study shows that the GPU implementation of the dual form of the SVM using the sequential minimal optimization algorithm leads to performance improvements of an order of magnitude in both training and classification. Finally, a technique that coordinates multiple GPUs to solve even larger classification problems is also presented in the chapter. © 2011 Copyright © 2011 NVIDIA Corporation and Wen-mei W.

	abstract = {. The solution of binary classi cation problems using support vector machines (SVMs) is well developed, but multi-class problems with more than two classes have typically been solved by combining independently produced binary classi ers. We propose a formulation of the SVM that enables a multi-class pattern recognition problem to be solved in a single optimisation. We also propose a similar generalization of linear programming machines. We report experiments using bench-mark datasets in which these two methods achieve a reduction in the number of support vectors and kernel calculations needed. 1. k-Class Pattern Recognition The k-class pattern recognition problem is to construct a decision function given ` iid (independent and identically distributed) samples (points) of an unknown function, typically with noise: (x1;y1);:::;(x`;y`) (1) where xi; i =1;:::;`is a vector of length d and yi 2f1;:::;kg represents the class of the sample. A natural loss function is the number of mistakes made. 2. Solving k-Class Problems with Binary SVMs For the binary pattern recognition problem (case k = 2), the support vector approach has been well developed [3, 5]. The classical approach to solving k-class pattern recognition problems is to consider the problem as a collection of binary classi cation problems. In the one-versus-rest method one constructs k classi ers, one for each class. The n th classi er constructs a hyperplane between class n and the k, 1 other classes. A particular point is assigned to the class for which the distance from the margin, in the positive direction (i.e. in the direction in which class {\textbackslash}one " lies rather than class {\textbackslash}rest"), is maximal.

After a point is added to a group, the mean of that group is adjusted so as to take account of the new point. Thus at each stage there are in fact k means, one for each group. After the sample is processed in this way, the points are classified on the basis of nearness to the final means.

Although existing knowledge discovery and data engineering techniques have shown great success in many real-world applications, the problem of learning from imbalanced data (the imbalanced learning problem) is a relatively new challenge that has attracted growing attention from both academia and industry. The imbalanced learning problem is concerned with the performance of learning algorithms in the presence of underrepresented data and severe class distribution skews. Due to the inherent complex characteristics of imbalanced data sets, learning from such data requires new understandings, principles, algorithms, and tools to transform vast amounts of raw data efficiently into information and knowledge representation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the development of research in learning from imbalanced data. Our focus is to provide a critical review of the nature of the problem, the state-of-the-art technologies, and the current assessment metrics used to evaluate learning performance under the imbalanced learning scenario. Furthermore, in order to stimulate future research in this field, we also highlight the major opportunities and challenges, as well as potential important research directions for learning from imbalanced data.},

	abstract = {Background: Few US health departments provide partner service (PS) to persons with gonorrhoea (GC) or chlamydia (CT). We sought to define the potential utility of providing PS to MSM with GC or CT as an HIV prevention intervention. Methods: We analysed public health reporting and PS data from WA State, USA, 2007-2010 to evaluate whether provider initiated case reports could identify MSM with GC or CT, to assess engagement in HIV care among MSM with STIs previously diagnosed with HIV, and to determine how often MSM HIV test when diagnosed with GC or CT. Estimates of previously diagnosed HIV, engagement with care, and HIV testing were derived from a random sample of cases weighted to reflect cases' residence and receipt of care in the King County STD clinic. We linked STI and HIV reporting data to estimate the risk of subsequent HIV diagnoses among MSM reported with GC or CT. Results: Medical providers recorded the gender of cases' sex partners on 19 000 (68\%) of 27 762 case reports on men with GC or CT, 4281 (22\%) of which indicated that the case had sex with men. Case report and PS interview data on cases' sexual orientation agreed in 6711 (96\%) of 6999 cases for which both data sources were available (=0.90). Agreement was higher for STD clinic cases (=0.98) than for other King County cases (=0.86) or among men outside of King County (=0.68). Among a random sample of 1103 cases identified as MSM in both case report and PS data, 25\% were previously diagnosed with HIV, of whom 87\% were in care and 63\% were on antiretrovirals. Among MSM without a prior HIV diagnosis, 55\% reported that they HIV tested when diagnosed with GC or CT. The proportion of MSM who HIV tested was higher STD clinic cases (82\%) than among other King County MSM (57\%) or MSM outside of King County (41\%) (p{\textless}0.0001). Nineteen (3.3\%) of 583 tested MSM were newly diagnosed with HIV. Among MSM without a prior HIV diagnosis who were not diagnosed with HIV at time of their GC or CT diagnosis, the subsequent rate of new HIV diagnosis was 2.5/100 person years. Among 1421 MSM diagnosed with HIV in WA State 2007-2010, 6.3\%, 9.6\%, and 11.9\% had been reported with GC or CT in the 1, 2, and 3 years prior to HIV diagnosis, respectively. Conclusions: MSM with GC and CTare an identifiable and accessible population at high risk for HIV acquisition and transmission who might benefit from efforts to increase HIV testing frequency and linkage to HIV care. Expanding PS for bacterial STI should be evaluated as a means to achieve these goals.},

Computation of these measures allows the user to perform clustering by using conventional clustering algorithms. TSclust also includes a clustering procedure based on p values from checking the equality of generating models, and some utilities to evaluate cluster solutions. The implemented dissimilarity functions are accessible individually for an easier extension and possible use out of the clustering context.

This article focuses on trends in income nonresponse over the past two decades in the Surveys of Consumers (SCA) conducted in the U.S. SCA asks respondents first to report their income in dollar amounts with an open-ended question. Those who do not provide an answer are followed up with a closed-ended question with income brackets. Analyses indicate that missing data on income has decreased over time, and the decline is related to respondents’ overall willingness to participate in the survey and to answer survey questions once in the survey. The results suggest that, for questions on household income, there exists a trade-off between unit and item nonresponse, which may have implications for income estimates and economic modeling.},

Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning.

	abstract = {Cluster analysis is a primary method for database mining. It is either used as a stand-alone tool to get insight into the distribution of a data set, e.g. to focus further analysis and data processing, or as a preprocessing step for other algorithms operating on the detected clusters. Almost all of the well-known clustering algorithms require input parameters which are hard to determine but have a significant influence on the clustering result. Furthermore, for many real-data sets there does not even exist a global parameter setting for which the result of the clustering algorithm describes the intrinsic cluster- ing structure accurately. We introduce a new algorithm for the pur- pose of cluster analysis which does not produce a clustering of a data set explicitly; but instead creates an augmented ordering of the database representing its density-based clustering structure. This cluster-ordering contains information which is equivalent to the density-based clusterings corresponding to a broad range of param- eter settings. It is a versatile basis for both automatic and interactive cluster analysis. We show how to automatically and efficiently extract not only ‘traditional’ clustering information (e.g. representa- tive points, arbitrary shaped clusters), but also the intrinsic cluster- ing structure. For medium sized data sets, the cluster-ordering can be represented graphically and for very large data sets, we introduce an appropriate visualization technique. Both are suitable for inter- active exploration of the intrinsic clustering structure offering addi- tional insights into the distribution and correlation of the data.},

Reduction of response burden, gains of production cost efficiency as well as potentials for detailed spatial-demographic and longitudinal statistics are some of the major advantages associated with the use of integrated statistical data. Data integration has always been an essential feature associated with the use of administrative register data. But survey and census data should also be integrated, so as to widen their scope and improve the quality. There are many new and difficult challenges here that are beyond the traditional topics of survey sampling and data integration. In this article we consider statistical theory for data integration on a conceptual level. In particular, we present a two-phase life-cycle model for integrated statistical microdata, which provides a framework for the various potential error sources, and outline some concepts and topics for quality assessment beyond the ideal of error-free data. A shared understanding of these issues will hopefully help us to collocate and coordinate efforts in future research and development.},

It is also helpful to use soft biometrics to improve the performance of traditional biometrics for human identification, such as face recognition. Different methods can be developed to recognize the soft biometric characteristics from face images. In this chapter, we present the application of the support vector machines (SVM) to learn an estimator or recognizer to extract these soft biometrics. We will mainly focus on age estimation, while the gender and ethnicity classification will also be discussed. Both classification and regression will be considered.

This study examined whether regime-switching models, which capture processes characterized by recurrent shifts between different states, provide clinically relevant information for characterizing individuals based on their temporal pain patterns. Patients with rheumatic diseases (N = 116) provided 7 to 8 momentary pain ratings per day for 2 weekly periods, separated by 3 months. Regime-switching models extracted measures of Average pain (mean level over time), Amplitude (magnitude of shifts in pain levels), Persistence (average duration of pain states), and Dominance (relative duration of higher vs lower pain states) for each patient and assessment period. After controlling for Average pain, the Persistence of pain states uniquely predicted emotional functioning measures, whereas the Dominance of higher pain uniquely predicted physical functioning and pain interference. Longitudinal analyses of changes over the 3 months largely replicated cross-sectional results. Furthermore, patients' retrospective judgments of their pain were uniquely predicted by Amplitude and Dominance of higher pain states, and global impressions of change over the 3 months were predicted by changes on Dominance, controlling for Average pain levels. The results suggest that regime-switching models can usefully capture temporal dynamics of pain and can contribute to an improved measurement of patients' pain intensity.},

The cognitive assessment of these functions often relies on tasks which admit a dynamic, or longitudinal, component requiring participants to flexibly adapt their behaviour during the unfolding of the task. An intriguing feature of such experimental protocols is that they allow the performance of an individual to change as the task unfolds. In this work, we propose a Latent Markov Model approach to capture some dynamic aspects of observed response patterns of both healthy and substance dependent individuals in a set-shifting task. In particular, data from a Wisconsin Card Sorting Test were analysed in order to represent performance trends in terms of latent cognitive states dynamics. The results highlighted how a dynamic modelling approach can considerably improve the amount of information a researcher, or a clinician, can obtain from the analysis of a set-shifting task.},

This approach was motivated by a smoking cessation clinical trial, where a bivariate longitudinal response involving both a continuous and a binomial response was collected for each participant to monitor smoking behavior. A Bayesian method using Markov chain Monte Carlo is used. Comparison of separate univariate response models to the bivariate response models was undertaken.

	abstract = {Latent variable hidden Markov models (LVHMMs) are important statistical methods in exploring the possible heterogeneity of data and explaining the pattern of subjects moving from one group to another over time. Classic subject- and/or time-homogeneous assumptions on transition matrices in transition model as well as the emission distribution in the observed process may be inappropriate to interpret heterogeneity at the subject level. For this end, a general extension of LVHMM is proposed to address the heterogeneity of multivariate longitudinal data both at the subject level and the occasion level. The main modeling strategy is that the observed time sequences are first grouped into different clusters, and then within each cluster the observed sequences are formulated via latent variable hidden Markov model. The local heterogeneity at the occasion level is characterized by the distribution related to the latent states, while the global heterogeneity at the subject level is identified with the finite mixture model. Compared to the existing methods, an appeal underlying the proposal is its capacity of accommodating non-homogeneous patterns of state sequences and emission distributions across the subjects simultaneously. As a result, the proposal provides a comprehensive framework for exploring various kinds of relevance among the multivariate longitudinal data. Within the Bayesian paradigm, Markov Chains Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is used to implement posterior analysis. Gibbs sampler is used to draw observations from the related full conditionals and posterior inferences are carried out based on these simulated observations. Empirical results including simulation studies and a real example are used to illustrate the proposed methodology.},

An HMM assumes that each data point from a time series of observations stems from one of N possible states. The states are loosely connected to behavioral modes that manifest themselves at the temporal resolution at which observations are made. Due to advances in tag technology and tracking with digital video recordings, data can be collected at increasingly fine temporal resolutions. Yet, inferences at time scales cruder than those at which data are collected and, which correspond to larger-scale behavioral processes, are not yet answered via HMMs. We include additional hierarchical structures to the basic HMM framework, incorporating multiple Markov chains at various time scales. The hierarchically structured HMMs allow for behavioral inferences at multiple time scales and can also serve as a means to avoid coarsening data. Our proposed framework is one of the first that models animal behavior simultaneously at multiple time scales, opening new possibilities in the area of animal movement and behavior modeling. We illustrate the application of hierarchically structured HMMs in two real-data examples: (i) vertical movements of harbor porpoises observed in the field, and (ii) garter snake movement data collected as part of an experimental design.

To tackle this challenge, a stochastic hybrid modeling framework based on a non-parametric Bayesian inference method, i.e., hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP), is investigated in this paper. This framework is able to jointly model driver/vehicle behavior through forecasting the vehicle dynamical time-series. This modeling framework could be merged with the notion of model-based information networking, which is recently proposed in the vehicular literature, to overcome the scalability challenges in dense vehicular networks via broadcasting the behavioral models instead of raw information dissemination. This modeling approach has been applied on several scenarios from the realistic Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) driving data set and the results show a higher performance of this model in comparison with the zero-hold method as the baseline.},

	abstract = {The problem of classifying human activities occurring in depth image sequences is addressed. The 3D joint positions of a human skeleton and the local depth image pattern around these joint positions define the features. A two level hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (H-HMM), with independent Markov chains for the joint positions and depth image pattern, is used to model the features. The states corresponding to the H-HMM bottom level characterize the granular poses while the top level characterizes the coarser actions associated with the activities. Further, the H-HMM is based on a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP), and is fully non-parametric with the number of pose and action states inferred automatically from data. This is a significant advantage over classical HMM and its extensions. In order to perform classification, the relationships between the actions and the activity labels are captured using multinomial logistic regression. The proposed inference procedure ensures alignment of actions from activities with similar labels. Our construction enables information sharing, allows incorporation of unlabelled examples and provides a flexible factorized representation to include multiple data channels. Experiments with multiple real world datasets show the efficacy of our classification approach.},

	abstract = {The trend for about twenty years, the research regarding the number of states in Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was mainly aimed at increasing it in order to ensure the robustness of the face recognition system. In this paper, a novel face recognition method is presented based on one state of discrete HMM, where it seemed impossible in the past. Contrary to other approaches that use the three parameters of the HMM to recognize faces, the proposed work uses only one parameter for discrimination, while the two others are fixed. The method starts with a pre-processing step to remove the influence of noise from the images using the median filter and the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), where at the same time; the DWT possesses a size reduction feature. The reduced size image is prepared to generate a sequence of overlapping blocks. The data manipulated by the model are produced by converting each block to an integer value using some statistical techniques and a quantization process, such that each image is described by a sequence of integers. The experimental results show that the use of one-state model highly reduces the computational complexity of the system and continues in achieving 100\% recognition rate, which can be considered a practical breakthrough in the field of face recognition that has superseded the other research efforts in reducing the number of states of HMM, and consequently accomplished reduction of computational complexity and ultimate enhancement of system performance.},

Navigating these tools is time-consuming and the search itself can hinder the learning of the skill. Educators are hence interested in aiding students by selecting the optimal content sequence for individual learners, specifically which skill one should learn next and which material one should use to study. Such adaptive selection would rely on pre-knowledge of how the learners’ and the instructional tools’ characteristics jointly affect the probability of acquiring a certain skill. Building upon previous research on Latent Transition Analysis and Learning Trajectories, we propose a multilevel logistic hidden Markov model for learning based on cognitive diagnosis models, where the probability that a learner acquires the target skill depends not only on the general difficulty of the skill and the learner’s mastery of other skills in the curriculum but also on the effectiveness of the particular learning tool and its interaction with mastery of other skills, captured by random slopes and intercepts for each learning tool. A Bayesian modeling framework and an MCMC algorithm for parameter estimation are proposed and evaluated using a simulation study.},

	abstract = {The movement of animals in groups is widespread in nature. Understanding this phenomenon presents an important problem in ecology with many applications that range from conservation to robotics. Underlying all group movements are interactions between individual animals and it is therefore crucial to understand the mechanisms of this social behaviour. To date, despite promising methodological developments, there are few applications to data of practical statistical techniques that inferentially investigate the extent and nature of social interactions in group movement. We address this gap by demonstrating the usefulness of a Hidden Markov Model approach to characterise individual-level social movement in published trajectory data on three-spined stickleback shoals (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and novel data on guppy shoals (Poecilia reticulata). With these models, we formally test for speed-mediated social interactions and verify that they are present. We further characterise this inferred social behaviour and find that despite the substantial shoal-level differences in movement dynamics between species, it is qualitatively similar in guppies and sticklebacks. It is intermittent, occurring in varying numbers of individuals at different time points. The speeds of interacting fish follow a bimodal distribution, indicating that they are either stationary or move at a preferred mean speed, and social fish with more social neighbours move at higher speeds, on average. Our findings and methodology present steps towards characterising social behaviour in animal groups.},

	abstract = {In a clinical trial of a treatment for alcoholism, a common response variable of interest is the number of alcoholic drinks consumed by each subject each day, or an ordinal version of this response, with levels corresponding to abstinence, light drinking and heavy drinking. In these trials, within-subject drinking patterns are often characterized by alternating periods of heavy drinking and abstinence. For this reason, many statistical models for time series that assume steady behavior over time and white noise errors do not fit alcohol data well. In this paper we propose to describe subjects' drinking behavior using Markov models and hidden Markov models (HMMs), which are better suited to describe processes that make sudden, rather than gradual, changes over time. We incorporate random effects into these models using a hierarchical Bayes structure to account for correlated responses within subjects over time, and we estimate the effects of covariates, including a randomized treatment, on the outcome in a novel way. We illustrate the models by fitting them to a large data set from a clinical trial of the drug Naltrexone. The HMM, in particular, fits this data well and also contains unique features that allow for useful clinical interpretations of alcohol consumption behavior. © 2010 Institute of Mathematical Statistics.},

For efficiency reasons the parameters of a HMM are often estimated with maximum likelihood and a segmentation is obtained with the Viterbi algorithm. This introduces considerable uncertainty in the segmentation, which can be avoided with Bayesian approaches integrating out parameters using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. While the advantages of Bayesian approaches have been clearly demonstrated, the likelihood based approaches are still preferred in practice for their lower running times; datasets coming from high-density arrays and next generation sequencing amplify these problems.Results: We propose an approximate sampling technique, inspired by compression of discrete sequences in HMM computations and by kd-trees to leverage spatial relations between data points in typical data sets, to speed up the MCMC sampling.Conclusions: We test our approximate sampling method on simulated and biological ArrayCGH datasets and high-density SNP arrays, and demonstrate a speed-up of 10 to 60 respectively 90 while achieving competitive results with the state-of-the art Bayesian approaches.Availability: An implementation of our method will be made available as part of the open source GHMM library from http://ghmm.org. © 2011 Mahmud and Schliep; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

To identify and characterize these three components, we propose to use semi-Markov switching linear mixed models, i.e., models that combine linear mixed models in a semi-Markovian manner. The underlying semi-Markov chain represents the succession of growth phases and their lengths (endogenous component) whereas the linear mixed models attached to each state of the underlying semi-Markov chain represent - in the corresponding growth phase - both the influence of time-varying climatic covariates (environmental component) as fixed effects, and interindividual heterogeneity (individual component) as random effects. In this article, we address the estimation of Markov and semi-Markov switching linear mixed models in a general framework. We propose a Monte Carlo expectation-maximization like algorithm whose iterations decompose into three steps: (i) sampling of state sequences given random effects, (ii) prediction of random effects given state sequences, and (iii) maximization. The proposed statistical modeling approach is illustrated by the analysis of successive annual shoots along Corsican pine trunks influenced by climatic covariates. © 2009, The International Biometric Society.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0014753},
	abstract = {Individual variation in maternal care in mammals shows a significant heritable component, with the maternal behavior of daughters resembling that of their mothers. In laboratory mice, genetically distinct inbred strains show stable differences in maternal care during the first postnatal week. Moreover, cross fostering and reciprocal breeding studies demonstrate that differences in maternal care between inbred strains persist in the absence of genetic differences, demonstrating a non-genetic or epigenetic contribution to maternal behavior. In this study we applied a mathematical tool, called hidden Markov model (HMM), to analyze the behavior of female mice in the presence of their young. The frequency of several maternal behaviors in mice has been previously described, including nursing/grooming pups and tending to the nest. However, the ordering, clustering, and transitions between these behaviors have not been systematically described and thus a global description of maternal behavior is lacking. Here we used HMM to describe maternal behavior patterns in two genetically distinct mouse strains, C57BL/6 and BALB/c, and their genetically identical reciprocal hybrid female offspring. HMM analysis is a powerful tool to identify patterns of events that cluster in time and to determine transitions between these clusters, or hidden states. For the HMM analysis we defined seven states: arched-backed nursing, blanket nursing, licking/grooming pups, grooming, activity, eating, and sleeping. By quantifying the frequency, duration, composition, and transition probabilities of these states we were able to describe the pattern of maternal behavior in mouse and identify aspects of these patterns that are under genetic and nongenetic inheritance. Differences in these patterns observed in the experimental groups (inbred and hybrid females) were detected only after the application of HMM analysis whereas classical statistical methods and analyses were not able to highlight them. © 2011 Carola et al.},

Summary This paper discusses the problem of estimating marginal likelihoods for mixture and Markov switching model. Estimation is based on the method of bridge sampling (Meng and Wong 1996; Statistica Sinica 11, 552-86.) where Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) draws from the posterior density are combined with an i.i.d. sample from an importance density. The importance density is constructed in an unsupervised manner from the MCMC draws using a mixture of complete data posteriors. Whereas the importance sampling estimator as well as the reciprocal importance sampling estimator are sensitive to the tail behaviour of the importance density, we demonstrate that the bridge sampling estimator is far more robust. Our case studies range from computing marginal likelihoods for a mixture of multivariate normal distributions, testing for the inhomogeneity of a discrete time Poisson process, to testing for the presence of Markov switching and order selection in the MSAR model.},

	abstract = {Bayesian estimation of a very general model class, where the distribution of the observations depends on a latent process taking values in a discrete state space, is discussed in this article. This model class covers finite mixture modeling, Markov switching autoregressive modeling, and dynamic linear models with switching. The consequences the unidentifiability of this type of model has on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation are explicitly dealt with. Joint Bayesian estimation of all latent variables, model parameters, and parameters that determine the probability law of the latent process is carried out by a new MCMC method called permutation sampling. The permutation sampler first samples from the unconstrained posterior–which often can be done in a convenient multimove manner–and then applies a permutation of the current labeling of the states of the latent process. In a first run, the random permutation sampler used selected the permutation randomly. The MCMC output of the random permutation sampler is explored to find suitable identifiability constraints. In a second run, the permutation sampler was used to sample from the constrained posterior by imposing identifiablity constraints. This time a suitable permutation is applied if the identifiability constraint is violated.

Because of such computational requirements, these algorithms are not practical when we wish to construct an HMM model with large state space and large explicit state duration and process a large amount of measurement data to obtain high accuracy. We propose a new forward-backward algorithm whose computational complexity is only O ((MD + M2) T), a reduction by almost a factor of D when D {\textgreater} M and whose memory requirement is O(MT). As an application example, we discuss an HMM characterization of access traffic observed at a large-scale Web site: we formulate the Web access pattern in terms of an HMM with explicit duration and estimate the model parameters using our algorithm.},

	abstract = {A hidden Markov model (HMM) encompasses a large class of stochastic process models and has been successfully applied to a number of scientific and engineering problems, including speech and other pattern recognition problems, and DNA sequence comparison. A hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) is an extension of HMM, designed to remove the constant or geometric distributions of the state durations assumed in HMM. A larger class of practical problems can be appropriately modeled in the setting of HSMM. A major restriction is found, however, in both conventional HMM and HSMM, i.e., it is generally assumed that there exists at least one observation associated with every state that the hidden Markov chain takes on. We will remove this assumption and consider the following situations: (i) observation data may be missing for some intervals; and (ii) there are multiple observation streams that are not necessarily synchronous to each other and may have different "emission distributions" for the same state. We propose a new and computationally efficient forward-backward algorithm for HSMM with missing observations and multiple observation sequences. The required computational amount for the forward and backward variables is reduced to O(D), where D is the maximum allowed duration in a state. Finally, we will apply the extended HSMM to estimate the mobility model parameters for the Internet service provisioning in wireless networks. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we present a user-independent deep learning-based approach for online human activity classification. We propose using Convolutional Neural Networks for local feature extraction together with simple statistical features that preserve information about the global form of time series. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of time series length on the recognition accuracy and limit it up to 1 s that makes possible continuous real-time activity classification. The accuracy of the proposed approach is evaluated on two commonly used WISDM and UCI datasets that contain labeled accelerometer data from 36 and 30 users respectively, and in cross-dataset experiment. The results show that the proposed model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance while requiring low computational cost and no manual feature engineering.},

The Bayesian Markov model is a flexible and efficient method for inference related to effects on behavior that considers dependence between current and past behaviors. We applied this model to behavior data from six greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons frontalis) during spring migration in mid-continent North America and considered likely drivers of behavior, including habitat, weather, and time of day effects. We modeled the transition between flying, feeding, stationary, and walking behavior states using a first-order Bayesian Markov model. We introduced P{\textbackslash}'olya-Gamma latent variables for automatic sampling of the covariate coefficients from the posterior distribution and we calculated the odds ratios from the posterior samples. The model provided a unifying framework for including both acceleration and Global Positioning System data. We found significant pairwise differences between transitions across habitat types, confirmed diurnal behavior and behavioral changes due to weather. Our model provided straightforward inference of behavioral time allocation across used habitats which is not amenable in activity budget or resource selection frameworks.},

We consider a chamber level analysis of trophallaxis interactions between carpenter ants ({\textbackslash}textit\{Camponotus pennsylvanicus\}) over 4 hours of second-by-second observations. The data show clear switches between fast and slow modes of trophallaxis. However, fitting a standard hidden Markov model (HMM) results in an estimated hidden state process that is overfit to this high resolution data, as the state process fluctuates an order of magnitude more quickly than is biologically reasonable. We propose a novel approach for penalized estimation of HMMs through a Bayesian ridge prior on the state transition rates while also incorporating biologically motivated covariates. This penalty induces smoothing, limiting the rate of state switching that combines with appropriate covariates within the colony to ensure more biologically feasible results. We develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to perform Bayesian inference based on discretized observations of the contact network.},

Recent advances to model the nonlinear dynamics in such time series data has suggested involving recurrent neural networks into Hidden Markov Models. Despite the success, however, this involvement has caused the inference procedure much more complicated, often leading to intractable inference, especially for the discrete variables of segmentation and labeling. To achieve both flexibility and tractability in modeling nonlinear dynamics of discrete variables and to model both the long-term dependencies and the uncertainty of the segmentation labels, we inherits the Recurrent Hidden Semi-Markov Model and presents an effective bi-directional inference method. In detail, the proposed bi-directional inference network reparameterizes the categorical segmentation with the Gumbel-Softmax approximation and resorts to the Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes. We evaluate the proposed model in a number of tasks, including speech modeling, automatic segmentation and labeling in behavior understanding, and sequential multi-objects recognition. Experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed model can achieve significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods.},

Previous work has explored modeling individual differences using machine learning algorithms performed on aggregated game actions. However, players’ individual differences may be better manifested through sequential patterns of the in-game player’s actions. While few works have explored sequential analysis of player data, none have explored the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to model individual differences, which is the topic of this paper. In particular, we developed a modeling approach using data collected from players playing a Role-Playing Game (RPG). Our proposed approach is two fold: 1. We present a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) of player in-game behaviors to model individual differences, and 2. using the output of the HMM, we generate behavioral features used to classify real world players’ characteristics, including game expertise and the big five personality traits. Our results show predictive power for some of personality traits, such as game expertise and conscientiousness, but the most influential factor was game expertise.},

The choice of GMM emission probability distributions allow to apply re-estimation routines to automatically adjust the HSMM emission probability distributions to each subject. Building on the proposed method for fine tuning emission distributions, a novel subject-driven unsupervised heart sound segmentation algorithm is proposed and validated over the publicly available PhysioNet dataset.

The reliability of the proposed approach is studied by evaluating its correlation with both a clinical assessment and a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm, while healthy and neurological disabled people performed physical exercises. With respect to the discrimination between healthy and pathological conditions, the HSMM based method correlates better with the physician's score than DTW.

We illustrate how the hidden Markov framework can be adapted to construct a compelling model for sub-daily rainfall, which is capable of capturing all of these important characteristics well. These adaptations include clone states and non-stationarity in both the transition matrix and conditional models. Set in the Bayesian framework, a rich quantification of both parametric and predictive uncertainty is available, and thorough model checking is made possible through posterior predictive analyses. Results from the model are interpretable, allowing for meaningful examination of seasonal variation and medium to long term trends in rainfall occurrence and intensity. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, both in terms of model fit and interpretability, we apply the model to an 8-year long time series of hourly observations.},

	abstract = {One of the central interests of animal movement ecology is relating movement characteristics to behavioural characteristics. The traditional discrete-time statistical tool for inferring unobserved behaviours from movement data is the hidden Markov model (HMM). While the HMM is an important and powerful tool, sometimes it is not flexible enough to appropriately fit the data. Data for marine animals often exhibit conditional autocorrelation, self-dependence of the step length process that cannot be explained solely by the behavioural state, which violates one of the main assumptions of the HMM. Using a grey seal track as an example we motivate and develop the conditionally autoregressive hidden Markov model (CarHMM), a generalization of the HMM designed specifically to handle conditional autocorrelation. In addition to introducing and examining the new CarHMM with numerous simulation studies, we provide guidelines for all stages of an analysis using either an HMM or CarHMM. These include guidelines for pre-processing location data to obtain deflection angles and step lengths, model selection, and model checking. In addition to these practical guidelines, we link estimated model parameters to biologically relevant quantities such as activity budget and residency time. We also provide interpretations of traditional “foraging” and “transiting” behaviours in the context of the new CarHMM parameters. Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online.},

	abstract = {Purpose Accelerometers are increasingly used to obtain valuable descriptors of physical activity for health research. The cut-points approach to segment accelerometer data is widely used in physical activity research but requires resource expensive calibration studies and does not make it easy to explore the information that can be gained for a variety of raw data metrics. To address these limitations, we present a data-driven approach for segmenting and clustering the accelerometer data using unsupervised machine learning. Methods The data used came from five hundred fourteen-year-old participants from the Millennium cohort study who wore an accelerometer (GENEActiv) on their wrist on one weekday and one weekend day. A Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM), configured to identify a maximum of ten behavioral states from five second averaged acceleration with and without addition of x, y, and z-angles, was used for segmenting and clustering of the data. A cut-points approach was used as comparison. Results Time spent in behavioral states with or without angle metrics constituted eight and five principal components to reach 95\% explained variance, respectively; in comparison four components were identified with the cut-points approach. In the HSMM with acceleration and angle as input, the distributions for acceleration in the states showed similar groupings as the cut-points categories, while more variety was seen in the distribution of angles. Conclusion Our unsupervised classification approach learns a construct of human behavior based on the data it observes, without the need for resource expensive calibration studies, has the ability to combine multiple data metrics, and offers a higher dimensional description of physical behavior. States are interpretable from the distributions of observations and by their duration.},

We propose a flexible and extensible continuous-time hidden Markov model to extract meaningful activity patterns from human accelerometer data. To facilitate estimation with massive data we derive an efficient learning algorithm that exploits the hierarchical structure of the parameters indexing the proposed model. We also propose a bootstrap procedure for interval estimation. The proposed methods are illustrated using data from the 2003 - 2004 and 2005 - 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.},

Wrist-worn accelerometer data were collected from (N = 152) adult participants; age 18–64 years, and processed the data to identify and model unique physical activities performed by the participants in controlled settings. The Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and the hidden Markov model (HMM) algorithms were used to model the physical activities with time and frequency-based accelerometer features. An overall model accuracy of 92.7\% and 94.7\% were achieved to classify 24 physical activities using GMM and HMM, respectively. The most accurate model was then used to identify physical activities performed by 20 participants, each recorded for two free-living sessions of approximately six hours each. The free-living activity intensities were estimated with 80\% accuracy and showed the dominance of stationary and light intensity activities in 36 out of 40 recorded sessions. This work proposes a novel activity recognition process to identify unsupervised free-living activities using lab-based classification models. In summary, this study contributes to the use of wearable sensors to identify physical activities and estimate energy expenditure in free-living settings.},

The initial processing of the input data was oriented towards extracting relevant time domain features of the EMG signal. Following the feature calculation, a piecewise modeling of the multidimensional EMG feature dynamics using vector autoregressive models was performed. The next step included the implementation of hierarchical hidden semi-Markov models to capture transitions between piecewise segments of movements and between different movements. Lastly, inversion of the model using an approximate Bayesian inference scheme served as the classifier. The effectiveness of the novel algorithms was assessed versus methods commonly used for real-time classification of EMGs in a prosthesis control application. The obtained results show that using hidden semi-Markov models as the top layer, instead of the hidden Markov models, ranks top in all the relevant metrics among the tested combinations. The choice of the presented methodology for the control of prosthetic hand is also supported by the equal or lower computational complexity required, compared to other algorithms, which enables the implementation on low-power microcontrollers, and the ability to adapt to user preferences of executing individual movements during activities of daily living.},

The artificial intelligence methods used are related to pattern recognition, and this study focuses on the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The data processing includes data cleaning, and the feature extraction techniques to define the inputs for the ANN. Due to the low processing power and memory of the mobile devices, they should be mainly used to acquire the data, applying an ANN previously trained for the identification of the ADL. The main purpose of this paper is to present a new method implemented with ANN for the identification of a defined set of ADL with a reliable accuracy. This paper also presents a comparison of different types of ANN in order to choose the type for the implementation of the final method.

However, most of the existing works focus on discriminative classifiers while neglecting the inherent time-series and continuous characteristics of sensor data. To address this, we propose a two-stage continuous hidden Markov model framework, which also takes advantage of the innate hierarchical structure of basic activities. This kind of system architecture not only enables the use of different feature subsets on different subclasses, which effectively reduces feature computation overhead, but also allows for varying number of states and iterations. Experiments show that the hierarchical structure dramatically increases classification performance. We analyze the behavior of the accelerometer and gyroscope signals for each activity through graphs, and with added fine tuning of states and training iterations, the proposed method is able to achieve an overall accuracy of up to 93.18\%, which is the best performance among the state-of-the-art classifiers for the problem at hand.},

Activity recognition provides core functionality to many types of systems including: Ambient Assisted Living, fitness trackers, behavior monitoring, security, and so on. The advent of wearable devices along with their diverse set of embedded sensors opens new opportunities for ubiquitous context sensing. Recently, wearable devices such as smartphones and smart-watches have been used for activity recognition and monitoring. Most of the previous works use inertial sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes) for activity recognition and combine them using an aggregation approach, i.e., extract features from each sensor and aggregate them to build the final classification model. This is not optimal since each sensor data source has its own statistical properties. In this work, we propose the use of a multi-view stacking method to fuse the data from heterogeneous types of sensors for activity recognition. Specifically, we used sound and accelerometer data collected with a smartphone and a wrist-band while performing home task activities. The proposed method is based on multi-view learning and stacked generalization, and consists of training a model for each of the sensor views and combining them with stacking. Our experimental results showed that the multi-view stacking method outperformed the aggregation approach in terms of accuracy, recall and specificity.},

	abstract = {Background: Objective measures using accelerometer-based activity monitors have been extensively used in physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) research. To measure PA and SB precisely, the field is shifting towards machine learning-based (ML) approaches for calibration and validation of accelerometer-based activity monitors. Nevertheless, various parameters regarding the use and development of ML-based models, including data type (raw acceleration data versus activity counts), sampling frequency, window size, input features, ML technique, accelerometer placement, and free-living settings, affect the predictive ability of ML-based models. The effects of these parameters on ML-based models have remained elusive, and will be systematically reviewed here. The open challenges were identified and recommendations are made for future studies and directions. Method: We conducted a systematic search of PubMed and Scopus databases to identify studies published before July 2017 that used ML-based techniques for calibration and validation of accelerometer-based activity monitors. Additional articles were manually identified from references in the identified articles. Results: A total of 62 studies were eligible to be included in the review, comprising 48 studies that calibrated and validated ML-based models for predicting the type and intensity of activities, and 22 studies for predicting activity energy expenditure. Conclusions: It appears that various ML-based techniques together with raw acceleration data sampled at 20-30 Hz provide the opportunity of predicting the type and intensity of activities, as well as activity energy expenditure with comparable overall predictive accuracies regardless of accelerometer placement. However, the high predictive accuracy of laboratory-calibrated models is not reproducible in free-living settings, due to transitive and unseen activities together with differences in acceleration signals.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND. Circadian timing of treatments can largely improve tolerability and efficacy in patients. Thus, drug metabolism and cell cycle are controlled by molecular clocks in each cell and coordinated by the core body temperature 24-hour rhythm, which is generated by the hypothalamic pacemaker. Individual circadian phase is currently estimated with questionnaire-based chronotype, center-of-rest time, dim light melatonin onset (DLMO), or timing of core body temperature (CBT) maximum (acrophase) or minimum (bathyphase). METHODS. We aimed at circadian phase determination and readout during daily routines in volunteers stratified by sex and age. We measured (a) chronotype, (b) every minute (q1min) CBT using 2 electronic pills swallowed 24 hours apart, (c) DLMO through hourly salivary samples from 1800 hours to bedtime, and (d) q1min accelerations and surface temperature at anterior chest level for 7 days, using a teletransmitting sensor. Circadian phases were computed using cosinor and hidden Markov modeling. Multivariate regression identified the combination of biomarkers that best predicted core temperature circadian bathyphase. RESULTS. Among the 33 participants, individual circadian phases were spread over 5 hours, 10 minutes (DLMO); 7 hours (CBT bathyphase); and 9 hours, 10 minutes (surface temperature acrophase). CBT bathyphase was accurately predicted, i.e., with an error less than 1 hour for 78.8\% of the subjects, using a new digital health algorithm (INTime), combining time-invariant sex and chronotype score with computed center-of-rest time and surface temperature bathyphase (adjusted R2 = 0.637). CONCLUSION. INTime provided a continuous and reliable circadian phase estimate in real time. This model helps integrate circadian clocks into precision medicine and will enable treatment timing personalization following further validation.},

In this study, we analyze the locomotion of fruit flies and show that this non-stereotyped behavior is well-described by a Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HHMM). HHMM shows that a fly's locomotion can be decomposed into a few locomotor features, and odors modulate locomotion by altering the time a fly spends performing different locomotor features. Importantly, although all flies in our dataset use the same set of locomotor features, individual flies vary considerably in how often they employ a given locomotor feature, and how this usage is modulated by odor. This variation is so large that the behavior of individual flies is best understood as being grouped into at least three to five distinct clusters, rather than variations around an average fly.},

	abstract = {Mathematical modeling of behavioral sequences yields insight into the rules and mechanisms underlying sequence generation. Grooming in Drosophila melanogaster is characterized by repeated execution of distinct, stereotyped actions in variable order. Experiments demonstrate that, following stimulation by an irritant, grooming progresses gradually from an early phase dominated by anterior cleaning to a later phase with increased walking and posterior cleaning. We also observe that, at an intermediate temporal scale, there is a strong relationship between the amount of time spent performing body-directed grooming actions and leg-directed actions. We then develop a series of data-driven Markov models that isolate and identify the behavioral features governing transitions between individual grooming bouts. We identify action order as the primary driver of probabilistic, but non-random, syntax structure, as has previously been identified. Subsequent models incorporate grooming bout duration, which also contributes significantly to sequence structure. Our results show that, surprisingly, the syntactic rules underlying probabilistic grooming transitions possess action duration-dependent structure, suggesting that sensory input-independent mechanisms guide grooming behavior at short time scales. Finally, the inclusion of a simple rule that modifies grooming transition probabilities over time yields a generative model that recapitulates the key features of observed grooming sequences at several time scales. These discoveries suggest that sensory input guides action selection by modulating internally generated dynamics. Additionally, the discovery of these principles governing grooming in D. melanogaster demonstrates the utility of incorporating temporal information when characterizing the syntax of behavioral sequences.},

	abstract = {A vital task for every organism is not only to decide what to do but also when to do it. For this reason, “circadian clocks” have evolved in virtually all forms of life. Conceptually, circadian clocks can be divided into two functional domains; an autonomous oscillator creates a {\textasciitilde}24 h self-sustained rhythm and sensory machinery interprets external information to alter the phase of the autonomous oscillation. It is through this simple design that variations in external stimuli (for example, daylight) can alter our sense of time. However, the clock’s simplicity ends with its basic concept. In metazoan animals, multiple external and internal stimuli, from light to temperature and even metabolism have been shown to affect clock time. This raises the fundamental question of cue integration: how are the many, and potentially conflicting, sources of information combined to sense a single time of day? Moreover, individual stimuli, are often detected through various sensory pathways. Some sensory cells, such as insect chordotonal neurons, provide the clock with both temperature and mechanical information. Adding confusion to complexity, there seems to be not only one central clock in the animal’s brain but numerous additional clocks in the body’s periphery. It is currently not clear how (or if) these “peripheral clocks” are synchronized to their central counterparts or if both clocks “tick” independently from one another. In this review article, we would like to leave the comfort zones of conceptual simplicity and assume a more holistic perspective of circadian clock function. Focusing on recent results from Drosophila melanogaster we will discuss some of the sensory, and computational, challenges organisms face when keeping track of time.},

	abstract = {Ever since the introduction of hidden Markov models by Baum and his co-workers, the method of choice for fitting such models has been maximum likelihood via the EM algorithm. In recent years it has been noticed that the gradient and Hessian of the log likelihood of hidden Markov and related models may be calculated in parallel with a filtering process by which the likelihood may be calculated. Various authors have used, or suggested the use of, this idea in order to maximize the likelihood directly, without using the EM algorithm. In this paper we discuss an implementation of such an approach. We have found that a straightforward implementation of Newton's method sometimes works but is unreliable. A form of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm appears to provide excellent reliability. Two rather complex examples are given for applying this algorithm to the fitting of hidden Markov models. In the first a better than 6-fold increase in speed over the EM algorithm was achieved. The second example turned out to be problematic (somewhat interestingly) in that the maximum likelihood estimator appears to be inconsistent. Whatever its merit, this estimator is calculated much faster by Levenberg-Marquardt than by EM. We also compared the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, applied to the first example, with a generic numerical maximization procedure. The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm appeared to perform almost three times better than the generic procedure, even when analytic derivatives were provided, and 19 times better when they were not provided. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Modeling sequence data using probabilistic finite state machines (PFSMs) is a technique that analyzes the underlying dynamics in sequences of symbols. Hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs) and hierarchical hidden Markov models (HHMMs) are PFSMs that have been successfully applied to a wide variety of applications by extending HMMs to make the extracted patterns easier to interpret. However, these models are independently developed with their own training algorithm, so that we cannot combine multiple kinds of structures to build a PFSM for a specific application. In this paper, we prove that silent hidden Markov models (silent HMMs) are flexible models that have more expressive power than HSMMs and HHMMs. Silent HMMs are HMMs that contain silent states, which do not emit any observations. We show that we can obtain silent HMM equivalent to given HSMMs and HHMMs. We believe that these results form a firm foundation to use silent HMMs as a unified representation for PFSM modeling.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a multi-centroid diastolic duration model for the hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) based heart sound segmentation. The centroids are calculated by hierarchical agglomerative clustering of the neighboring diastolic duration values using Ward's method until center of clusters are found at least a systolic duration apart. The multiple peak distribution yields a sharper gradient of likelihood around the expected centroids and improves the discriminability of similar observations. The peak density at each centroid acts as a reference point for the HSMM to determine the origin of the hidden-state and adjust the corresponding state duration based on the maximum likelihood criterion. This model overcomes the limitation of the single peak mean value model that may overfit the duration distribution when the heart rate variation is relatively large. An extended logistic regression-HSMM algorithm using the proposed duration model is presented for the heart sound segmentation. In addition, the total variation filter is used to attenuate the effect of noises and emphasize the fundamental heart sounds, S1 and S2. The proposed method is evaluated on the training-set-a of 2016 Physionet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge and yields an average F1 score of 98.36 ± 0.43.},

The effort required to obtain and annotate such datasets is massive, therefore we propose a smart annotation pipeline which reduces the number of events needing manual adjustment to 14\%. For scenarios dominated by walking, this annotation effort is as low as 8\%. The pipeline consists of three smart annotation approaches, namely edge detection of the pressure data, local cyclicity estimation, and iteratively trained hierarchical hidden Markov models. Using this pipeline, we have collected and labeled a dataset with over 150,000 labeled cycles, each with 2 phases, from 80 subjects, which we have made publicly available. The dataset consists of 12 different task-driven activities, 10 of which are cyclic. These activities include not only straight and steady-state motions, but also transitions, different ranges of bouts, and changing directions. Each participant wore 5 synchronized inertial measurement units (IMUs) on the wrists, shoes, and in a pocket, as well as pressure insoles and video. We believe that this dataset and smart annotation pipeline are a good basis for creating a benchmark dataset for validation of other semi- and unsupervised algorithms.},

In this paper, we propose a hidden semi-Markov-based model to understand the behavior of mobile entities. The hierarchical state structure in our model allows capturing spatiotemporal associations in the locational history both at staypoints and on the paths connecting them. We compare the accuracy of our model with a number of other spatiotemporal models using two real datasets. Furthermore, we perform sensitivity analysis on our model to evaluate its robustness in presence of common issues in mobility datasets such as existence of noise and missing values.

We describe a number of extensions of HMMs for animal movement modeling, including more flexible state transition models and individual random effects (fitted in a non-Bayesian framework). In particular we consider so-called hidden semi-Markov models, which may substantially improve the goodness of fit and provide important insights into the behavioral state switching dynamics.

A wide range of graphical models have been proposed for these tasks, and are typically extensions of the generative hidden Markov models (HMMs) or their discriminative counterpart, conditional random fields (CRFs). These extensions typically address one of three key limitations in the basic HMM/CRF formalism - unrealistic models for the duration of a sub-event, not encoding interactions among multiple agents directly and not modeling the inherent hierarchical organization of activities. In our work, we present a family of graphical models that generalize such extensions and simultaneously model event duration, multi agent interactions and hierarchical structure. We also present general algorithms for efficient learning and inference in such models based on local variational approximations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by developing graphical models for applications in automatic sign language (ASL) recognition, and for gesture and action recognition in videos.

	abstract = {Doubly hidden Markov models (DHMMs) have been widely used to analyze a type of time process whose driving factors are hierarchical and hierarchically correlated. A common issue of these models is that they implicitly assume that the dwell time of any system state is constant or exponentially distributed. This property comes from the standard hidden Markov models and causes the DHMM to limitations in some actual application environment, where an application has latent temporal structure and does not follow the exponential distribution but has the period-like or variable-period feature. Such problems are frequently encountered in practice, e.g. network traffic. In this paper, we remove this limitation by a new structural discrete approach named nested hidden semi-Markov model. The proposed model includes a nested latent semi-Markov chain and one observable discrete stochastic process. The bottom latent semi-Markov chain is the core layer and controls the second-layer semi-Markov chain that generates the observable process. The state duration of both the semi-Markov chains can be variable or explicit. The model makes no assumptions on the distribution of the state-duration and the observable processes. An efficient forward and backward recursion procedure is developed for estimating the generator of the proposed model and inferring the underlying state processes for a given observation sequence. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we apply the model to the arrival process of network traffic and compare its simulation traffic and the real traffic. The performance evaluation in the experiments includes time dynamic process, auto-correlation, cross-correlation, statistical distribution and self-similarity. © 2012 The Author.},

New parameters, feature saliencies, are introduced to the model and used to select features that distinguish between states. The feature saliencies represent the probability that a feature is relevant by distinguishing between state-dependent and state-independent distributions. An expectation maximization algorithm is used to calculate maximum a posteriori estimates for model parameters. An exponential prior on the feature saliencies is compared with a beta prior. These priors can be used to include cost in the model estimation and feature selection process. This algorithm is tested against maximum likelihood estimates and a variational Bayesian method. For the HMM, four formulations are compared on a synthetic data set generated by models with known parameters, a tool wear data set, and data collected during a painting process. For the HSMM, two formulations, maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori, are tested on the latter two data sets, demonstrating that the feature saliency method of feature selection can be extended to semi-Markov processes. The literature on feature selection specifically for HMMs is sparse, and non-existent for HSMMs. This paper fills a gap in the literature concerning simultaneous feature selection and parameter estimation for HMMs using the EM algorithm, and introduces the notion of selecting features with respect to cost for HMMs.},

	doi = {10.1111/2041-210X.12657},
	abstract = {Use of accelerometers is now widespread within animal biologging as they provide a means of measuring an animal's activity in a meaningful and quantitative way where direct observation is not possible. In sequential acceleration data, there is a natural dependence between observations of behaviour, a fact that has been largely ignored in most analyses. Analyses of acceleration data where serial dependence has been explicitly modelled have largely relied on hidden Markov models (HMMs). Depending on the aim of an analysis, an HMM can be used for state prediction or to make inferences about drivers of behaviour. For state prediction, a supervised learning approach can be applied. That is, an HMM is trained to classify unlabelled acceleration data into a finite set of pre-specified categories. An unsupervised learning approach can be used to infer new aspects of animal behaviour when biologically meaningful response variables are used, with the caveat that the states may not map to specific behaviours. We provide the details necessary to implement and assess an HMM in both the supervised and unsupervised learning context and discuss the data requirements of each case. We outline two applications to marine and aerial systems (shark and eagle) taking the unsupervised learning approach, which is more readily applicable to animal activity measured in the field. HMMs were used to infer the effects of temporal, atmospheric and tidal inputs on animal behaviour. Animal accelerometer data allow ecologists to identify important correlates and drivers of animal activity (and hence behaviour). The HMM framework is well suited to deal with the main features commonly observed in accelerometer data and can easily be extended to suit a wide range of types of animal activity data. The ability to combine direct observations of animal activity with statistical models, which account for the features of accelerometer data, offers a new way to quantify animal behaviour and energetic expenditure and to deepen our insights into individual behaviour as a constituent of populations and ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are a rich family of probabilistic time series models with a long and successful history of applications in natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, bioinformatics, and many other areas of engineering, statistics and computer science. A defining property of HMMs is that the time series is modelled in terms of a number of discrete hidden states. Usually, the number of such states is specified in advance by the modeller, but this limits the flexibility of HMMs. Recently, attention has turned to Bayesian methods which can automatically infer the number of states in an HMM from data. A particularly elegant and flexible approach is to assume a countable but unbounded number of hidden states; this is the nonparametric Bayesian approach to hidden Markov models first introduced by Beal et al. [4] and called the infinite HMM (iHMM). In this chapter, we review the literature on Bayesian inference in HMMs, focusing on nonparametric Bayesian models. We show the equivalence between the Polya urn interpretation of the infinite HMM and the hierarchical Dirichlet process interpretation of the iHMM in Teh et al. [35]. We describe efficient inference algorithms, including the beam sampler which uses dynamic programming. Finally, we illustrate how to use the iHMM on a simple sequence labelling task and discuss several extensions.},

The siHMM is well suited to segmentation problems, where the goal is to identify points at which a time series transitions from one relatively stable regime to a new regime. Conventional iHMMs often struggle with such problems, since they have no mechanism for distinguishing between high- and low-level dynamics. Hierarchical HMMs (HHMMs) can do better, but they require much more complex and expensive inference algorithms. The siHMM retains the simplicity and efficiency of the iHMM, but outperforms it on a variety of segmentation problems, achieving performance that matches or exceeds that of a more complicated HHMM.},

In this manuscript (mixed) hidden Markov models (HMMs) are used to model the feeding behaviour of 54 subadult grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus), small nocturnal primates endemic to Madagascar that forage solitarily. Our primary aim is to introduce ecologists and other users to various HMM methods, many of which have been developed only recently, and which in this form have not previously been synthesized in the ecological literature. Our specific application of mixed HMMs aims at gaining a better understanding of mouse lemur behaviour, in particular concerning sex-specific differences. The model we consider incorporates random effects for accommodating heterogeneity across animals, i.e. accounts for different personalities of the animals. Additional subject- and time-specific covariates in the model describe the influence of sex, body mass and time of night.},

	abstract = {Cocaine addiction is chronic and persistent, and has become a major social and health problem in many countries. Existing studies have shown that cocaine addicts often undergo episodic periods of addiction to, moderate dependence on, or swearing off cocaine. Given its reversible feature, cocaine use can be formulated as a stochastic process that transits from one state to another, while the impacts of various factors, such as treatment received and individuals’ psychological problems on cocaine use, may vary across states. This article develops a hidden Markov latent variable model to study multivariate longitudinal data concerning cocaine use from a California Civil Addict Program. The proposed model generalizes conventional latent variable models to allow bidirectional transition between cocaine-addiction states and conventional hidden Markov models to allow latent variables and their dynamic interrelationship. We develop a maximum-likelihood approach, along with a Monte Carlo expectation conditional maximization (MCECM) algorithm, to conduct parameter estimation. The asymptotic properties of the parameter estimates and statistics for testing the heterogeneity of model parameters are investigated. The finite sample performance of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by simulation studies. The application to cocaine use study provides insights into the prevention of cocaine use.},

However, it is often complex to describe, visualize, and compare large sequence data, especially when there are multiple parallel sequences per subject. Hidden (latent) Markov models (HMMs) are able to detect underlying latent structures and they can be used in various longitudinal settings: to account for measurement error, to detect unobservable states, or to compress information across several types of observations. Extending to mixture hidden Markov models (MHMMs) allows clustering data into homogeneous subsets, with or without external covariates. The seqHMM package in R is designed for the efficient modeling of sequences and other categorical time series data containing one or multiple subjects with one or multiple interdependent sequences using HMMs and MHMMs. Also other restricted variants of the MHMM can be fitted, e.g., latent class models, Markov models, mixture Markov models, or even ordinary multinomial regression models with suitable parameterization of the HMM. Good graphical presentations of data and models are useful during the whole analysis process from the first glimpse at the data to model fitting and presentation of results. The package provides easy options for plotting parallel sequence data, and proposes visualizing HMMs as directed graphs.},

Our presentation concentrates on the conceptual steps involved in carrying out power or precision calculations by simulation. We demonstrate these steps in three examples concerned with (i) drop out in longitudinal studies, (ii) measurement error in observational studies and (iii) causal effect estimation in randomised controlled trials with non-compliance.

But when the observed states are subject to measurement error, the observed transitions between two points in time will be partially spurious. Latent Markov models make it possible to separate true change from measurement error. The standard latent Markov model is, however, rather limited when the aim is to explain individual differences in the probability of occupying a particular state at a particular point in time. This paper presents a flexible logit regression approach which allows to regress the latent states occupied at the various points in time on both time-constant and time-varying covariates. The regression approach combines features of causal log-linear models and latent class models with explanatory variables. In an application pupils' interest in physics at different points in time is explained by the time-constant covariate sex and the time-varying covariate physics grade.

These definitions are reviewed and an alternative "sample realizations" definition is presented. Another section briefly describes identification, latent variable indeterminancy, and other properties common to models with latent variables. The paper then reviews the role of latent variables in multiple regression, probit and logistic regression, factor analysis, latent curve models, item response theory, latent class analysis, and structural equation models. Though these application areas are diverse, the paper highlights the similarities as well as the differences in the manner in which the latent variables are defined and used. It concludes with an evaluation of the different definitions of latent variables and their properties.},

When potentially many HMMs are embedded within a hierarchical model, this can result in prohibitively long MCMC runtimes. We study combinations of existing methods, which are shown to vastly improve computational efficiency for these hierarchical models while maintaining the modeling flexibility provided by embedded HMMs. The methods include discrete filtering of the HMM likelihood to remove latent states, reduced data representations, and a novel procedure for dynamic block sampling of posterior dimensions. The first two methods have been used in isolation in existing application-specific software, but are not generally available for incorporation in arbitrary model structures. Using the NIMBLE package for R, we develop and test combined computational approaches using three examples from ecological capture-recapture, although our methods are generally applicable to any embedded discrete HMMs. These combinations provide several orders of magnitude improvement in MCMC sampling efficiency, defined as the rate of generating effectively independent posterior samples. In addition to being computationally significant for this class of hierarchical models, this result underscores the potential for vast improvements to MCMC sampling efficiency which can result from combinations of known algorithms.},

Second, I prove that the numerical error accumulates sublinearly in the number of time periods integrated, so the total error can be well controlled for a very large number of periods using, for example, Gaussian quadrature and Chebyshev polynomials.

Hidden semi-Markov chains generalize hidden Markov chains and enable the modeling of various durational structures.

	abstract = {Medical researchers interested in temporal, multivariate measurements of complex diseases have recently begun developing health state models, which divide the space of patient characteristics into medically distinct clusters. The current state of the art in health services research uses k-means clustering to form the health states and a first-order Markov chain to describe transitions between the states. This fitting procedure ignores information from temporally adjacent observations and prevents uncertainty from parameter estimation and cluster assignments from being incorporated into the analysis. A natural way to address these issues is to combine clustering and longitudinal analyses using a hidden Markov model. We fit hidden Markov models to longitudinal data using Bayesian methods that account for all of the uncertainty in the parameters, conditional only on the underlying correctness of the model. Potential lack of time homogeneity in the Markov chain is accounted for by embedding transition probabilities into a hierarchical model that provides Bayesian shrinkage across time. We illustrate this approach by developing a hidden Markov health state model for comparing the effectiveness of clozapine and haloperidol, two antipsychotic medications for schizophrenia. We find that clozapine outperforms haloperidol and identify the types of patients in whom clozapine's advantage is greatest and weakest. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of hidden Markov models in comparison with the current methodology. © 2005 American Statistical Association.},

	doi = {10.1002/sim.6039},
	abstract = {Questionnaire-based health status outcomes are often prone to misclassification. When studying the effect of risk factors on such outcomes, ignoring any potential misclassification may lead to biased effect estimates. Analytical challenges posed by these misclassified outcomes are further complicated when simultaneously exploring factors for both the misclassification and health processes in a multi-level setting. To address these challenges, we propose a fully Bayesian mixed hidden Markov model (BMHMM) for handling differential misclassification in categorical outcomes in a multi-level setting. The BMHMM generalizes the traditional hidden Markov model (HMM) by introducing random effects into three sets of HMM parameters for joint estimation of the prevalence, transition, and misclassification probabilities. This formulation not only allows joint estimation of all three sets of parameters but also accounts for cluster-level heterogeneity based on a multi-level model structure. Using this novel approach, both the true health status prevalence and the transition probabilities between the health states during follow-up are modeled as functions of covariates. The observed, possibly misclassified, health states are related to the true, but unobserved, health states and covariates. Results from simulation studies are presented to validate the estimation procedure, to show the computational efficiency due to the Bayesian approach and also to illustrate the gains from the proposed method compared to existing methods that ignore outcome misclassification and cluster-level heterogeneity. We apply the proposed method to examine the risk factors for both asthma transition and misclassification in the Southern California Children's Health Study. © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Methods that can identify underlying behaviors driving specific movement patterns can help us understand how and why animals use available space, thereby aiding conservation and management efforts. For aquatic animal tracking data with significant measurement error, a Bayesian state-space model called the first-Difference Correlated Random Walk with Switching (DCRWS) has often been used for this purpose. However, for aquatic animals, highly accurate tracking data are now becoming more common. We developed a new hidden Markov model (HMM) for identifying behavioral states from animal tracks with negligible error, called the hidden Markov movement model (HMMM). We implemented as the basis for the HMMM the process equation of the DCRWS, but we used the method of maximum likelihood and the R package TMB for rapid model fitting. The HMMM was compared to a modified version of the DCRWS for highly accurate tracks, the DCRWSNOME, and to a common HMM for animal tracks fitted with the R package moveHMM. We show that the HMMM is both accurate and suitable for multiple species by fitting it to real tracks from a grey seal, lake trout, and blue shark, as well as to simulated data. The HMMM is a fast and reliable tool for making meaningful inference from animal movement data that is ideally suited for ecologists who want to use the popular DCRWS implementation and have highly accurate tracking data. It additionally provides a groundwork for development of more complex modeling of animal movement with TMB. To facilitate its uptake, we make it available through the R package swim.},

Empirical evidence for the psychometric qualities in the United States thus far is solid, but no such data exist for the Dutch language version. In this study we aim to investigate the higher order factor structure of the Personality Syndrome (PS) scales and Trait Dimension (TD) scales of the Dutch language version of the SWAP-200 (SWAP-200-NL) in a psychiatric outpatient sample (N = 282). For the TD scales Cronbach's α is also calculated. Results show acceptable to good overall reliability (i.e., Cronbach's α). Higher order factor analysis of the SWAP-200 (PS) reveals four maladaptive factors that resemble both the higher order personality traits conceptualized in section III of DSM-5 (APA, 2013), as well as the constructs identified by Widiger and Simonsen (2005) after integrating 18 alternative proposals for dimensional classification. Additionally, High-Functioning Depressive PS was most prevalent in our outpatient sample. While this PS is not described in DSM-5, it is discussed here as a possibly overlooked, clinically relevant construct. Finally, this study replicates previously identified higher order factors of the TD, adding to the instrument's robustness.},

	abstract = {The development of foraging strategies that enable juveniles to efficiently identify and exploit predictable habitat features is critical for survival and long-term fitness. In the marine environment, meso- and sub-mesoscale features such as oceanographic fronts offer a visible cue to enhanced foraging conditions, but how individuals learn to identify these features is a mystery. In this study, we investigate age-related differences in the fine-scale foraging behaviour of adult (aged 5 years) and immature (aged 2–4 years) northern gannets Morus bassanus. Using high-resolution GPS-loggers, we reveal that adults have a much narrower foraging distribution than immature birds and much higher individual foraging site fidelity. By conditioning the transition probabilities of a hidden Markov model on satellite-derived measures of frontal activity, we then demonstrate that adults show a stronger response to frontal activity than immature birds, and are more likely to commence foraging behaviour as frontal intensity increases. Together, these results indicate that adult gannets are more proficient foragers than immatures, supporting the hypothesis that foraging specializations are learned during individual exploratory behaviour in early life. Such memory-based individual foraging strategies may also explain the extended period of immaturity observed in gannets and many other long-lived species.},

In this respect, we propose a nursing home performance indicator, which is essentially a probability to avoid resident health status worsening. Specifically, latent Markov models with covariates and normally distributed continuous random effects are fitted to produce standardised 180-day ahead transition matrices, upon which the aforementioned index is based. Nursing home effects on these transition matrices are modelled through fixed as well as random effects. The performance index is used to build two distinct rankings, one of which also accounts for the variability induced by the estimation process. In this framework, several rankings can be obtained by combining the model specification (fixed vs. random effects), the kind of ranking and the number of latent states, which is the typical sensitivity parameter of latent Markov models. Our methodological approach is applied to a dataset which was gathered from a health protocol implemented in Umbria (Italy). Results for this data show a rather high degree of robustness, in the sense that the obtained rankings are almost the same.},

In this article, we propose a vector autoregressive Bayesian dynamic model that is useful for emotion dynamic research. The model encompasses 6 elementary properties of emotions and can be applied with relatively short time series, including missing data. The individual elementary properties covered are within-person variability, innovation variability, inertia, granularity, cross-lag regression, and average intensity. The model can be applied to both univariate and multivariate time series, allowing one to model the relationships between emotions. One may include external variables and non-Gaussian observed data. We illustrate the usefulness of the model on data involving 50 participants self-reporting on their experience of 3 emotions across the period of 1 week using experience sampling.},

We find that a 3-cluster model with 3 states per cluster performs best amongst the configurations tested, and the feasibility of HMMs as applied to multi-item EMA data is demonstrated. However, there is substantial heterogeneity between participants within each hidden state for which sampling error due to short observation periods is a likely contributor.

Among the most pressing of these challenges is of understanding the role of aging in the development of dementia. This article is motivated by the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging data for 4742 subjects since 2004, and how it can be used to draw inference on the role of aging in the development of dementia. We construct a hidden Markov model (HMM) to represent progression of dementia from states associated with the buildup of amyloid plaque in the brain, and the loss of cortical thickness. A hierarchical Bayesian approach is taken to estimate the parameters of the HMM with a truly time-inhomogeneous infinitesimal generator matrix, and response functions of the continuous-valued biomarker measurements are cut-point agnostic. A Bayesian approach with these features could be useful in many disease progression models. Additionally, an approach is illustrated for correcting a common bias in delayed enrollment studies, in which some or all subjects are not observed at baseline. Standard software is incapable of accounting for this critical feature, so code to perform the estimation of the model described below is made available online.

	abstract = {Many visual analytics tools exist to assist users in examining large amounts of information at once via coordinated views that include graphs, network connections and maps. However, the cognitive processes that those users undergo while using such tools remain a mystery. Many psychological studies suggest that individuals may undergo some planning stage followed by analysis before finally making conclusions when examining large amounts of analytical data with the goal of reaching a decision. While the general order of these cognitive states has been theorized, the exact states of individuals at specific points during their interaction with visual analytic systems remain unclear. In this work, we developed models to determine the cognitive states of users based solely on their interactions with visual analytics systems via Hidden Markov Models. Hidden Markov Models allow for the classification of observations through hidden states (cognitive states in our case) as well as the prediction of future cognitive states. We generate these models through unsu-pervised learning and use established metrics such as AIC and BIC metrics to evaluate our models. Our solutions are designed to help improve visual analytics tools by providing a better understanding of cognitive thought processes of users during data intensive analysis tasks.},

As virtual environments, every action users make while interacting with these tools can be carefully logged, as can the state of the software and the information it presents to the user, giving these actions context. This data provides a high-resolution lens through which dynamic cognitive and behavioral processes can be viewed. In this report, we describe new methods for the analysis and interpretation of such data, utilizing a novel implementation of the Beta Process Hidden Markov Model (BP-HMM) for analysis of software activity logs. We further report the results of a preliminary study designed to establish the validity of our modeling approach. A group of 20 participants were asked to play a simple computer game, instrumented to log every interaction with the interface. Participants had no previous experience with the game's functionality or rules, so the activity logs collected during their naive interactions capture patterns of exploratory behavior and skill acquisition as they attempted to learn the rules of the game. Pre- and post-task questionnaires probed for self-reported styles of problem solving, as well as task engagement, difficulty, and workload. We jointly modeled the activity log sequences collected from all participants using the BP-HMM approach, identifying a global library of activity patterns representative of the collective behavior of all the participants. Analyses show systematic relationships between both pre- and post-task questionnaires, self-reported approaches to analytic problem solving, and metrics extracted from the BP-HMM decomposition. Overall, we find that this novel approach to decomposing unstructured behavioral data within software environments provides a sensible means for understanding how users learn to integrate software functionality for strategic task pursuit.},

Objective We assessed the stability of cancer patients' LST preferences at EOL by identifying distinct LST preference states and examining the probability of each state transitioning to other states between consecutive time points. Methods Stability of LST preferences (cardiopulmonary resuscitation, intensive care unit [ICU] care, cardiac massage, intubation with mechanical ventilation, intravenous nutrition support, and nasogastric tube feeding) was examined among 303 cancer patients in their last six months by hidden Markov modeling. Results Six distinct LST preference states (initial size) were identified: uniformly preferring (8.3\%), uniformly rejecting (33.8\%), and uniformly uncertain about (20.5\%) LST, favoring intravenous nutrition support but rejecting other treatments (19.9\%), and favoring (3.6\%) or uncertain about (14.0\%) nutrition support and ICU care while rejecting other treatments. Shifts between LST preference states were relatively small between any two time points (transition probability of staying at the same state was 92.1\% to 97.5\%), except for the state characterized by uncertainty about nutrition support and ICU care while rejecting other treatments, in which 8.3\% of patients shifted LST preferences toward uniform uncertainty at a subsequent assessment. Conclusions Our patients' LST preferences remained stable without prominent shifts toward preferring less aggressive LSTs even when death approached. Clarifying patients' understanding and expectations about LST efficacy and tailoring interventions to the unique needs of patients in each state may provide personalized EOL care.},

This paper revisited an ESM data set (Lu, Huet, \& Dube, 2011) that observed 160 participants’ food consumption and momentary emotions 6 times per day in 10 days. Focusing on the analyses on feedback loop between mood and meal-healthiness decision, the proposed reciprocal Markov model (RMM) can accommodate both hidden (“general” emotional states: positive vs. negative state) and observed states (meal: healthier, same or less healthy than usual) without presuming independence between observations and smooth trajectories of mood or behavior changes. The results of RMM analyses illustrated the reciprocal chains of meal consumption and mood as well as the effect of contextual factors that moderate the interrelationship between eating and emotion. A simulation experiment that generated data consistent with the empirical study further demonstrated that the procedure is promising in terms of recovering the parameters.},

Epoch-by-epoch comparisons were made between our HMM algorithm and that embedded in the Actiwatch software (AS). The percent agreement between HMM and PSG was 85.7\%, and that between AS and PSG was 84.7\%. Positive predictive values for sleep epochs were 85.6\% and 84.6\% for HMM and AS, respectively, and 95.5\% and 85.6\% for wake epochs. Both methods have similar performance and tend to overestimate sleep and underestimate wake compared to PSG. Our HMM approach is able to quantify the variability in activity counts that allow us to differentiate relatively active and sedentary individuals: individuals with higher estimated variabilities tend to show more frequent sedentary behaviors. In conclusion, our unsupervised data-driven HMM algorithm achieves slightly better performance compared to the commonly used algorithm in the Actiwatch software. HMM can help expand the application of actigraphy in large-scale studies and in cases where intrusive PSG is hard to acquire or unavailable. In addition, the estimated HMM parameters can characterize individual activity patterns that can be utilized for further analysis.},

The issues related to the estimation of Poisson-hidden Markov models in which the observations are coming from mixture of Poisson distributions and the parameters of the component Poisson distributions are governed by an m-state Markov chain with an unknown transition probability matrix are explained here. These methods were applied to the data on Vibrio cholerae counts reported every month for 11-year span at Christian Medical College, Vellore, India. Using Viterbi algorithm, the best estimate of the state sequence was obtained and hence the transition probability matrix. The mean passage time between the states were estimated. The 95\% confidence interval for the mean passage time was estimated via Monte Carlo simulation. The three hidden states of the estimated Markov chain are labelled as ‘Low’, ‘Moderate’ and ‘High’ with the mean counts of 1.4, 6.6 and 20.2 and the estimated average duration of stay of 3, 3 and 4 months, respectively. Environmental risk factors were studied using Markov ordinal logistic regression analysis. No significant association was found between disease severity levels and climate components.},

	abstract = {Health interventions using real-time sensing technology are characterized by intensive longitudinal data, which has the potential to enable nuanced evaluations of individuals’ responses to treatment. Existing analytic tools were not developed to capitalize on this opportunity as they typically focus on first-order findings such as changes in the level and/or slope of outcome variables over different intervention phases. This paper introduces an exploratory, Markov-based empirical transition method that offers a more comprehensive assessment of behavioral responses when intensive longitudinal data are available. The procedure projects a univariate time-series into discrete states and empirically determines the probability of transitioning from one state to another. State transition probabilities are summarized separately in phase-specific transition matrices. Comparing transition matrices illuminates intricate, quantifiable differences in behavior between intervention phases. Statistical significance is estimated via bootstrapping techniques. This paper introduces the methodology via three case studies from a secondhand smoke reduction trial utilizing real-time air particle sensors. Analysis enabled the identification of complex phenomena such as avoidance and escape behavior in response to punitive contingencies for tobacco use. Additionally, the largest changes in behavior dynamics were associated with the introduction of behavioral feedback. The Markov approach‘s ability to elucidate subtle behavioral details has not typically been feasible with standard methodologies, mainly due to historical limitations associated with infrequent repeated measures. These results suggest that the evaluation of intervention effects in data-intensive single-case designs can be enhanced, providing rich information that can ultimately be used to develop interventions uniquely tailored to specific individuals.},

They allow to account for both time-constant and time-varying sources of unobserved heterogeneity, which are frequent in this kind of studies. Individual-specific latent features, which may be either constant or varying over time, are included in the linear predictor and lead to a general form of dependence between individual measurements. When a parametric (continuous) distribution is associated to time-constant random parameters, the estimation process requires the calculation of (multiple) integrals. These, generally, have not a closed form and should be numerically approximated. The aim is to compare the standard, the adaptive and the pseudo-adaptive Gaussian quadrature approximations by means of a large scale simulation study, where continuous and discrete responses with (conditional) density in the exponential family are considered. Simulation results show that the approximation error is often substantially reduced when the adaptive quadrature rules are considered in place of the standard one. Such an improvement comes at the cost of a higher computational complexity when the fully adaptive scheme is applied. It is shown that, when a sufficient number of repeated measurements per unit is available, the pseudo-adaptive quadrature represents a convenient compromise between quality of results and computational complexity.},

	abstract = {Drawing inferences about dynamics of psychological constructs from intensive longitudinal data requires the measurement model (MM)-indicating how items relate to constructs-to be invariant across subjects and time-points. When assessing subjects in their daily life, however, there may be multiple MMs, for instance, because subjects generally differ in their item interpretation or because the response style of (some) subjects changes over time. The recently proposed "latent Markov factor analysis" (LMFA) evaluates (violations of) measurement invariance by classifying observations into separate latent "states" according to the MM that underlies these observations such that MMs differ between states but are invariant within one state. However, LMFA is limited to normally distributed continuous data and estimates may be inaccurate when applying the method to ordinal data (e.g., from Likert items) with skewed responses or few response categories. To enable researchers and health professionals with ordinal data to evaluate MM differences and changes, we present "latent Markov latent trait analysis" (LMLTA), which builds upon LMFA but treats responses as ordinal. Our application shows differences in the MM of adolescents' affective well-being in different social contexts, highlighting the importance of studying measurement invariance to draw accurate inferences for psychological science and practice.},

We use a discrete time hidden Markov model for each disease with transition probabilities dependent on covariates via a set of logistic regressions. For each disease the hidden states for each of the other diseases at a given time point form part of the covariate set for the Markov transition probabilities from that time point. This allows us to gauge the influence of each parasite species on the transition probabilities for each of the other parasite species. Inference is performed via a Gibbs sampler, which cycles through each of the diseases, first using an adaptive Metropolis-Hastings step to sample from the conditional posterior of the covariate parameters for that particular disease given the hidden states for all other diseases and then sampling from the hidden states for that disease given the parameters. We find evidence for interactions between several pairs of parasites and of an acquired immune response for two of the parasites. © 2013 Royal Statistical Society.},

	abstract = {Higher education in America is characterized by widespread access to college but low rates of completion, especially among undergraduates at less selective institutions. We analyze longitudinal transcript data to examine processes leading to graduation, using Hidden Markov modeling. We identify several latent states that are associated with patterns of course taking, and show that a trained Hidden Markov model can predict graduation or nongraduation based on only a few semesters of transcript data. We compare this approach to more conventional methods and conclude that certain college-specific processes , associated with graduation, should be analyzed in addition to socioeconomic factors. The results from the Hidden Markov trajectories indicate that both graduating and nongraduating students take the more difficult mathematical and technical courses at an equal rate. However, undergraduates who complete their bachelor's degree within 6 years are more likely to alternate between these semesters with a heavy course load and the less course-intense semesters. The course-taking patterns found among college students also indicate that nongraduates withdraw more often from coursework than average, yet when graduates withdraw, they tend do so in exactly those semesters of the college career in which more difficult courses are taken. These findings, as well as the sequence methodology itself, emphasize the importance of careful course selection and counseling early on in student's college career.},

However, little is known about the role of stimulus control for eating in non-clinical populations, and no studies so far have looked at eating and drinking behaviour simultaneously. Method: 53 individuals from the general population took part in an intensive longitudinal study with repeated, real-time assessments of eating and drinking using Ecological Momentary Assessment. Eating was assessed as main meals and snacks, drinks assessments were separated along alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Situational and internal stimuli were assessed during both eating and drinking events, and during randomly selected non-eating occasions. Hierarchical multinomial logistic random effects models were used to analyse data, comparing dietary events to non-eating occasions. Results: Several situational and affective antecedents of dietary behaviours could be identified. Meals were significantly associated with having food available and observing others eat. Snacking was associated with negative affect, having food available, and observing others eat. Engaging in activities and being with others decreased the likelihood of eating behaviours. Non-alcoholic drinks were associated with observing others eat, and less activities and company. Alcoholic drinks were associated with less negative affect and arousal, and with observing others eat. Conclusions: Results support the role of stimulus control in dietary behaviours, with support for both internal and external, in particular availability and social stimuli. The findings for negative affect support the idea of comfort eating, and results point to the formation of eating habits via cue-behaviour associations.},

The question of whether speakers prime themselves is central to adjudicating between two theories of syntactic priming, activation-based theories and expectation-based theories. However, there is a lack of a statistical model to investigate the two different theories when nominal repeated measures are obtained from multiple participants and items. This paper presents a Markov mixed-effect multinomial logistic regression model in which there are fixed and random effects for own-category lags and cross-category lags in a multivariate structure and there are category-specific crossed random effects (random person and item effects). The model is illustrated with experimental data that investigates the average and participant-specific deviations in syntactic self-priming effects. Results of the model suggest that evidence of self-priming is consistent with the predictions of activation-based theories.

The objective of this study is to identify causal factors affecting the motorcycle crashes at both four-legged and T signalized intersections. Treating the data in time-series cross-section panels, this study explores different Hierarchical Poisson models and found that the model allowing autoregressive lag-1 dependence specification in the error term is the most suitable. Results show that the number of lanes at the four-legged signalized intersections significantly increases motorcycle crashes largely because of the higher exposure resulting from higher motorcycle accumulation at the stop line. Furthermore, the presence of a wide median and an uncontrolled left-turn lane at major roadways of four-legged intersections exacerbate this potential hazard. For T signalized intersections, the presence of exclusive right-turn lane at both major and minor roadways and an uncontrolled left-turn lane at major roadways increases motorcycle crashes. Motorcycle crashes increase on high-speed roadways because they are more vulnerable and less likely to react in time during conflicts. The presence of red light cameras reduces motorcycle crashes significantly for both four-legged and T intersections. With the red light camera, motorcycles are less exposed to conflicts because it is observed that they are more disciplined in queuing at the stop line and less likely to jump start at the start of green. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Classical random-effects based solutions include the Poisson-gamma model, which uses the conjugacy between the Poisson and gamma distributions, but which does not model spatial correlation, on the one hand, and the more advanced CAR model, which also introduces a spatial autocorrelation term but without a closed-form posterior distribution on the other. In this paper, a combined model is proposed: an alternative convolution model accounting for both overdispersion and spatial correlation in the data by combining the Poisson-gamma model with a spatially-structured normal CAR random effect. The Limburg Cancer Registry data on kidney and prostate cancer in Limburg were used to compare the conventional and new models. A simulation study confirmed results and interpretations coming from the real datasets.

Further, HMMs can be extended to include more than one observation source and are then multivariate HMMs. In this work MHMMs were developed and applied in a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease example. The two hidden states included in the model were remission and exacerbation and two observation sources were considered, patient reported outcomes (PROs) and forced expiratory volume (FEV1). Estimation properties in the software NONMEM of model parameters were investigated with and without random and covariate effect parameters. The influence of including random and covariate effects of varying magnitudes on the parameters in the model was quantified and a power analysis was performed to compare the power of a single bivariate MHMM with two separate univariate MHMMs. A bivariate MHMM was developed for simulating and analysing hypothetical COPD data consisting of PRO and FEV1 measurements collected every week for 60 weeks. Parameter precision was high for all parameters with the exception of the variance of the transition rate dictating the transition from remission to exacerbation (relative root mean squared error [RRMSE] {\textgreater} 150\%). Parameter precision was better with higher magnitudes of the transition probability parameters. A drug effect was included on the transition rate probability and the precision of the drug effect parameter improved with increasing magnitude of the parameter. The power to detect the drug effect was improved by utilizing a bivariate MHMM model over the univariate MHMM models where the number of subject required for 80\% power was 25 with the bivariate MHMM model versus 63 in the univariate MHMM FEV1 model and {\textgreater} 100 in the univariate MHMM PRO model. The results advocates for the use of bivariate MHMM models when implementation is possible.},

	abstract = {Clear-sky index (CSI) generative models are of paramount importance in, e.g., studying the integration of solar power in the electricity grid. Several models have recently been proposed with methodologies that are related to hidden Markov models (HMMs). In this paper, we formally employ HMMs, with Gaussian distributions, to generate CSI time-series. The authors propose two different methodologies. The first is a completely data-driven approach, where an HMM with Gaussian observation distributions is proposed. In the second, the means of these Gaussian observation distributions were predefined based on the fraction of time of bright sunshine from the site. Finally, the authors also propose a novel method to improve the autocorrelation function (ACF) of HMMs in general. The two methods were tested on two datasets representing two different climate regions. The performance of the two methodologies varied between the two datasets and among the compared performance metrics. Moreover, both the proposed methods underperformed in reproducing the ACF as compared to state-of-the-art models. However, the method proposed to improve the ACF was able to reduce the mean absolute error (MAE) of the ACF by up to 19\%. In summary, the proposed models were able to achieve a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test score as low as 0.042 and MAE of the ACF as low as 0.012. These results are comparable with the state-of-the-art models. Moreover, the proposed models were fast to train. HMMs are shown to be viable CSI generative models. The code for the model and the simulations performed in this paper can be found in the GitHub repository: HMM-CSI-generativeModel.},

Unfortunately, very few published simulation studies provide sufficient details to allow readers to understand fully all the processes required to design a simulation study. When planning a simulation study, it is recommended that a detailed protocol be produced, giving full details of how the study will be performed, analysed and reported. This paper details the important considerations necessary when designing any simulation study, including defining specific objectives of the study, determining the procedures for generating the data sets and the number of simulations to perform. A checklist highlighting the important considerations when designing a simulation study is provided.

The main theme of this paper is to provide guidelines for the analysts to select an appropriate sample size while fitting multilevel logistic regression models for different threshold parameters and different estimation methods. Simulation studies have been performed to obtain optimum sample size for Penalized Quasi-likelihood (PQL) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) Methods of estimation. Our results suggest that Maximum Likelihood Method performs better than Penalized Quasi-likelihood Method and requires relatively small sample under chosen conditions. To achieve sufficient accuracy of fixed and random effects under ML method, we established ''50/50" and ''120/50" rule respectively. On the basis our findings, a ''50/60" and ''120/70" rules under PQL method of estimation have also been recommended.},

	abstract = {Background. Many studies conducted in health and social sciences collect individual level data as outcome measures. Usually, such data have a hierarchical structure, with patients clustered within physicians, and physicians clustered within practices. Large survey data, including national surveys, have a hierarchical or clustered structure; respondents are naturally clustered in geographical units (e.g., health regions) and may be grouped into smaller units. Outcomes of interest in many fields not only reflect continuous measures, but also binary outcomes such as depression, presence or absence of a disease, and self-reported general health. In the framework of multilevel studies an important problem is calculating an adequate sample size that generates unbiased and accurate estimates. Methods. In this paper simulation studies are used to assess the effect of varying sample size at both the individual and group level on the accuracy of the estimates of the parameters and variance components of multilevel logistic regression models. In addition, the influence of prevalence of the outcome and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) is examined. Results. The results show that the estimates of the fixed effect parameters are unbiased for 100 groups with group size of 50 or higher. The estimates of the variance covariance components are slightly biased even with 100 groups and group size of 50. The biases for both fixed and random effects are severe for group size of 5. The standard errors for fixed effect parameters are unbiased while for variance covariance components are underestimated. Results suggest that low prevalent events require larger sample sizes with at least a minimum of 100 groups and 50 individuals per group. Conclusion. We recommend using a minimum group size of 50 with at least 50 groups to produce valid estimates for multi-level logistic regression models. Group size should be adjusted under conditions where the prevalence of events is low such that the expected number of events in each group should be greater than one. © 2007 Moineddin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {When the goal of prevention research is to capture in statistical models some measure of the dynamic complexity in structures and processes implicated in problem behavior and its prevention, approaches such as multilevel modeling (MLM) and structural equation modeling (SEM) are indicated. Yet the assumptions that must be satisfied if these approaches are to be used responsibly raise concerns regarding their use in prevention research involving smaller samples. In this manuscript we discuss in nontechnical terms the role of sample size in MLM and SEM and present findings from the latest simulation work on the performance of each approach at sample sizes typical of prevention research. For each statistical approach, we draw from extant simulation studies to establish lower bounds for sample size (e.g., MLM can be applied with as few as 10 groups comprising 10 members with normally distributed data, restricted maximum likelihood estimation, and a focus on fixed effects; sample sizes as small as N = 50 can produce reliable SEM results with normally distributed data and at least three reliable indicators per factor) and suggest strategies for making the best use of the modeling approach when N is near the lower bound. Keywords sample size; multilevel modeling; structural equation modeling This manuscript focuses on sample size considerations in applications of two statistical methods of particular relevance to prevention research questions-multilevel modeling (MLM) and structural equation modeling (SEM). MLM and SEM are used to fullest advantage when the goal is to model a structure or process as opposed to isolated tests of individual parameters such as correlation coefficients or mean differences. Models of structure focus on the nature of the relations between variables that define a complex construct (e.g., impulsivity, Whiteside \& Lynam, 2001) or domain (e.g., problem behavior, Gillmore, Hawkins, Catalano, Day, \& Abbott 1991). Models of process focus on causal relations and the mechanisms that account for them as specified by theoretical models (e.g., Shiyko, Lanza, Tan, Li, \& Shiffman, 2012). The value of such models to the work of prevention scientists is clear. The suitability of data from small-sample prevention studies for evaluating such models is not always clear.},

	abstract = {Recent methodological research has addressed the important issue of sample size at each level when estimating multilevel models. Although several design factors have been investigated in these studies, differences between continuous and binary predictor variables have not been scrutinized (previous findings are based on models with continuous predictor variables). To help address this gap in the literature, this Monte Carlo study focused on the consequences of level-2 sparseness on the estimation of fixed and random effects coefficients in terms of model convergence and both point and interval parameter estimates. The 5,760 conditions simulated in the Monte Carlo study varied in terms of level-1 sample size, number of level-2 units, proportion of singletons (level-2 units with one observation), type of predictor, collinearity, intraclass correlation, and model complexity. 1. Sample Size and Multilevel Modeling Multilevel models are being increasingly used across the social sciences to analyze nested or hierarchically structured data. There are many types of multilevel models, which differ in terms of the number of levels (e.g., 2, 3), type of design (e.g., cross-sectional, longitudinal with repeated measures, cross-classified), scale of the outcome variable (e.g., continuous, categorical), and number of outcomes (e.g., univariate, multivariate). These models have been used to address a variety of research questions involving model parameters that include fixed effects (e.g., average student socioeconomic status-mathematics achievement slope across schools), random level-1 coefficients (e.g., student socioeconomic status-mathematics achievement slope at a particular school), and variance-covariance components (e.g., amount of variation in the student socioeconomic status-mathematics achievement slope across schools). As the use of multilevel models (also known as hierarchical linear models and mixed models) has expanded into new areas, questions have emerged concerning how well these models work under various design conditions. One of these design conditions is the sample size at each level of the analysis. This issue is central in most quantitative studies but is more complex in multilevel models because of the multiple levels of analysis. Currently there are few sample size guidelines referenced in the literature. One rule of thumb proposed for designs in which individuals are nested within groups calls for a minimum of 30 units at each level of the analysis. This rule of thumb is commonly cited (see, for example},

	abstract = {Analysing longitudinal declarative data raises many difficulties, such as the processing of errors and missingness in the outcome variable. Moreover, long-term monitored cohorts (commonly encountered in life-course epidemiology) may reveal a problem of time heterogeneity, especially regarding the way subjects respond to the investigator. We propose a Mixed Hidden Markov Model which considers several causes of randomness in response and also enables the effect of a past health outcome to act on present responses through a memory state. Hence, we take into account both errors and missing responses, time heterogeneity, and retrospective questions. We thus propose a Stochastic Expectation Maximization algorithm (SEM), which is less time-consuming than usual EM algorithms to perform the estimation of the parameters of our MHMM. We carry out a simulation study to assess the performances of this algorithm in the context of cancer epidemiology with the British NCDS 1958 cohort. Simulations show that the effect of covariates on the transitions probabilities is estimated with moderate bias. At last, we investigate a brief real data application on the effect of early social class on cancer through a smoking behaviour. It appears that in the female sample we used, the early social class does not mainly act on smoking behaviours. Moreover, more information is needed to compensate for data missingness and declarative errors in the view to improve our statistical analysis. Résumé : L'analyse de données déclaratives longitudinales fait apparaître de nombreuses difficultés, comme le traitement des erreurs et des données manquantes de la variable de sortie. En outre, les cohortes suivies sur le long terme, telles que celles utilisées en épidémiologie "life-course" peuvent soulever un problème d'hétérogénéité du temps, surtout en ce qui concerne la façon de répondre aux questions de l'enquêteur. Nous proposons dans cet article l'introduction d'un modèle de Markov caché mixte qui comprend les possibilités d'erreur et de non-réponse, et permet également de considérer que l'effet d'un résultat de santé passé peut agir sur les réponses actuelles à travers une mémoire d' état. En ce qui concerne les estimations, nous avons proposé d'utiliser un algorithme EM Stochastique (SEM), qui est moins gourmand en temps de calcul que l'algorithme EM usuel utilisant une intégration sur les effets aléatoires. Nous avons effectué une étude par simulation afin d'évaluer les performances de cet algorithme dans le contexte de l'épidémiologie du cancer avec les données de la cohorte britanniques "NCDS 1958". Les simulations ont montré que l'effet des covariables sur les probabilités de transitions a été estimée avec un biais modéré. Enfin, nous avons réalisé une application à des données réelles en étudiant l'effet de la classe sociale précoce sur le cancer à travers un comportement tabagique. Il est apparu que, dans l'échantillon de femmes utilisé pour cette enquête, la classe sociale précoce n'agit pas principalement sur l'usage du tabac. Cependant, plus d'information est nécessaire pour compenser les données manquantes et les erreurs de déclaration et obtenir de meilleurs résultats statistiques.},

We develop and apply multilevel, multinomial logistic regression models for analyzing such data. These statistical methods correspond to the multinomial character of the response variable while also accounting for the repeated observations of individuals that characterize behavioral datasets. Correlated random effects potentially reveal individual-level trade-offs across behaviors, allowing for models that reveal the extent to which individuals who regularly engage in one behavior also exhibit relatively more or less of another behavior. Using an example dataset, we demonstrate the estimation of these models using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithms, as implemented in the RStan package in the R statistical environment. The supplemental files include a coding script and data that demonstrate auxiliary functions to prepare the data, estimate the models, summarize the posterior samples, and generate figures that display model predictions. We discuss possible extensions to our approach, including models with random slopes to allow individual-level behavioral strategies to vary over time and the need for models that account for temporal autocorrelation. These models can potentially be applied to a broad class of statistical analyses by behavioral ecologists, focusing on other polytomous response variables, such as behavior, habitat choice, or emotional states.},

Dryad data: https://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.sn0c503. abstract: We present a statistical approach-a custom-built hidden Markov model (HMM)-that is broadly applicable to the analysis of temporally clustered display events, as found in many animals, including birds, orthopterans, and anurans. This HMM can simultaneously estimate both the expected lengths of each animal's display bouts and their within-bout display rates. We highlight the HMM's ability to estimate changes in animals' display effort over time and across different social contexts, using data from male greater sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). Male display effort was modeled across three sites in two experimental treatments (robotic female simulating interested or uninterested behavior) and in the presence or absence of live females. Across contexts, we show that sage grouse males primarily adjust their bout lengths rather than their within-bout display rates. Males' responses to female behavior were correlated with male mating success: males with more matings showed high display persistence regardless of female behavior, while males with fewer mat-ings tended to invest selectively in females that were already showing interest in mating. Additionally, males with higher mating success responded more to the presence of a female than males with fewer matings did. We conclude with suggestions for adapting our HMM approach for use in other animal systems.},

	abstract = {Behavioral data can be important for effective management of endangered marine predators, but can be challenging to obtain. We utilized suction cup-attached biologging tags equipped with stereo hydrophones, triaxial accelerometers, triaxial magnetometers, pressure and temperature sensors, to characterize the subsurface behavior of an endangered population of killer whales (Orcinus orca). Tags recorded depth, acoustic and movement behavior on fish-eating killer whales in the Salish Sea between 2010–2014. We tested the hypotheses that (a) distinct behavioral states can be characterized by integrating movement and acoustic variables, (b) subsurface foraging occurs in bouts, with distinct periods of searching and capture temporally separated from travel, and (c) the probabilities of transitioning between behavioral states differ by sex. Using Hidden Markov modeling of two acoustic and four movement variables, we identified five temporally distinct behavioral states. Persistence in the same state on a subsequent dive had the greatest likelihood, with the exception of deep prey pursuit, indicating that behavior was clustered in time. Additionally, females spent more time at the surface than males, and engaged in less foraging behavior. These results reveal significant complexity and sex differences in subsurface foraging behavior, and underscore the importance of incorporating behavior into the design of conservation strategies.},

	doi = {10.1002/ece3.4850},
	abstract = {Occupancy models are an important statistical technique that was developed to make use of detection/nondetection data to infer the probability that a species under investigation occupies a site. When an occupancy study is undertaken, n s sites are visited a number of times to estimate the occupancy probability () and conditional detection probability (p) of a species associated with each site in a region. The method can be viewed as an extension of logistic regression and allows one to estimate the occupancy probability at Abstract Occupancy models (Ecology, 2002; 83: 2248) were developed to infer the probability that a species under investigation occupies a site. Bayesian analysis of these models can be undertaken using statistical packages such as WinBUGS, OpenBUGS, JAGS, and more recently Stan, however, since these packages were not developed specifically to fit occupancy models, one often experiences long run times when undertaking an analysis. Bayesian spatial single-season occupancy models can also be fit using the R package stocc. The approach assumes that the detection and occupancy regression effects are modeled using probit link functions. The use of the logistic link function, however, is algebraically more tractable and allows one to easily interpret the coefficient effects of an estimated model by using odds ratios, which is not easily done for a probit link function for models that do not include spatial random effects. We develop a Gibbs sampler to obtain posterior samples from the posterior distribution of the parameters of various occupancy models (nonspatial and spatial) when logit link functions are used to model the regression effects of the detection and occupancy processes. We apply our methods to data extracted from the 2nd Southern African Bird Atlas Project to produce a species distribution map of the Cape weaver (Ploceus capensis) and helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris) for South Africa. We found that the Gibbs sampling algorithm developed produces posterior samples that are identical to those obtained when using JAGS and Stan and that in certain cases the posterior chains mix much faster than those obtained when using JAGS, stocc, and Stan. Our algorithms are implemented in the R package, Rcppocc. The software is freely available and stored on GitHub (https://github.com/AllanClark/Rcppocc).},

	title = {Fast and {Accurate} {Estimation} of {Hierarchical} {Models} using {Variational} {Algorithms}},
	abstract = {Hierarchical models are commonly used in political science to address unobserved heterogeneity and model dependencies between observations. Inference for these models is typically conducted by maximum likelihood estimation or fully Bayesian analysis. Both methods can be slow on even moderately sized datasets, especially for non-linear models. This paper addresses this by deriving new algorithms for finding the maximum likelihood estimate using fast variatio-nal Expectation Maximization (EM), leveraging recent advances in data augmentation. These algorithms outperform existing variational methods on simulated data and closely recover the point estimates of "gold standard" methods on both simulated and actual datasets. I also provide a method for calculating approximate standard errors that has reasonable performance. I reexamine two papers in detail and show that simple extensions (e.g. adding an additional random effect) dramatically increase the computational cost for existing methods but only lead to modest increases for the variational approach. Hierarchical models-often known as multilevel models or "random effects" models-are ubiquitous in the social sciences. While they can take on many forms, this paper focuses on hierarchical models that place a mean-zero (multivariate) normal distribution on the random effects (Gelman and Hill 2006). Some common uses in political science are to address unobserved heterogeneity (Clark and Linzer 2015; Bell and Jones 2015), allow effects to vary across units (e.g. country; Stegmueller 2013) explicitly incorporate dependence between observations (Steenbergen and Jones 2002), and extrapolate survey data to smaller geographic units (Park, Gelman, and Bafumi 2004; Lax and Phillips 2009; Ghitza and Gelman 2013).

	abstract = {There has been considerable interest in making Bayesian inference more scalable. In big data settings, most of the focus has been on reducing the computing time per iteration rather than reducing the number of iterations needed in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). This article considers data augmentation MCMC (DA-MCMC), a widely used technique. DA-MCMC samples tend to become highly autocorrelated in large samples, due to a mis-calibration problem in which conditional posterior distributions given augmented data are too concentrated. This makes it necessary to collect very long MCMC paths to obtain acceptably low MC error. To combat this inefficiency, we propose a family of calibrated data augmentation algorithms, which appropriately adjust the variance of conditional posterior distributions. A Metropolis-Hastings step is used to eliminate bias in the stationary distribution of the resulting sampler. Compared to existing alternatives, this approach can dramatically reduce MC error by reducing autocorrelation and increasing the effective number of DA-MCMC samples per unit of computing time. The approach is simple and applicable to a broad variety of existing data augmentation algorithms. We focus on three popular generalized linear models: probit, logistic and Poisson log-linear. Dramatic gains in computational efficiency are shown in applications.},

These so-called 'nested designs' yield data that cannot be considered to be independent, and so violate the independency assumption of conventional statistical methods such as the t test. Ignoring this dependency results in a probability of incorrectly concluding that an effect is statistically significant that is far higher (up to 80\%) than the nominal level (usually set at 5\%). We discuss the factors affecting the type I error rate and the statistical power in nested data, methods that accommodate dependency between observations and ways to determine the optimal study design when data are nested. Notably, optimization of experimental designs nearly always concerns collection of more truly independent observations, rather than more observations from one research object. © 2014 Nature America, Inc.

This paper develops an operational precipitation forecasting scheme, using Bayesian Non-homogeneous Hidden Markov Chain (NHMM) model and teleconnection index. Although the Hidden Markov Chain model has been investigated before in similar studies, the NHMM algorithm employed in this study allows modeling both non-stationary transition probabilities and emission matrix. Climatic teleconnection that affect precipitation is used to drive changes in transition probabilities of different states in the Markov model. The proposed framework is illustrated for multiple-station precipitation analysis in NingXiang County, a southern inland area in China with a high population density. A simulation model is constructed to examine the model’s capacity in capturing variabilities and temporal-spatial characteristics exhibiting in monthly precipitation data during 1961–2013. Results indicate that the proposed NHMM model captures the precipitation characteristics at different stations well. Spearman correlation between conditional mean of simulated ensembles and observed data is 0.87–0.9, with few variations at distinct stations. The proposed framework has general applications and can be applied to simulate and generate stochastic monthly precipitation. Further application of the method is also described in the paper.},

We introduce two state NHHMMs where the time series are modeled via different predictive regression models for each state.

In a hidden Markov setting, inference for logistic regression coefficients becomes complicated and in some cases impossible due to convergence issues. In this paper we try to address this problem.

Given an available set of predictors, we allow for model uncertainty regarding the predictors that affect the series both linearly-in the mean-and non-linearly-in the transition matrix. Predictor selection and inference on the model parameters are based on a MCMC scheme with reversible jump steps.

It is common in practice to introduce temporal nonhomogeneity into such models by making the transition probabilities dependent on time-varying exogenous input variables via a multinomial logistic parametrization. We extend such models to introduce additional nonhomogeneity into the emission distribution using a generalized linear model (GLM), with data augmentation for sampling-based inference. However, the presence of the logistic function in the state transition model significantly complicates parameter inference for the overall model, particularly in a Bayesian context. To address this, we extend the recently-proposed Pólya-Gamma data augmentation approach to handle nonhomogeneous hidden Markov models (NHMMs), allowing the development of an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling scheme. We apply our model and inference scheme to 30 years of daily rainfall in India, leading to a number of insights into rainfall-related phenomena in the region.

	abstract = {Objective: A fundamental challenge in treating epilepsy is that changes in observed seizure frequencies do not necessarily reflect changes in underlying seizure risk. Rather, changes in seizure frequency may occur due to probabilistic variation around an underlying seizure risk state caused by normal fluctuations from natural history, leading to seizure unpredictability and potentially suboptimal medication adjustments in epilepsy management. However, no rigorous statistical approach exists to systematically distinguish expected changes in seizure frequency due to natural variability from changes in underlying seizure risk. Methods: Using data from SeizureTracker.com, a patient-reported seizure diary tool containing over 1.2 million recorded seizures across 8 years, a novel epilepsy seizure risk assessment tool (EpiSAT) employing a Bayesian mixed-effects hidden Markov model for zero-inflated count data was developed to estimate changes in underlying seizure risk using patient-reported seizure diary and clinical measurement data. Accuracy for correctly assessing underlying seizure risk was evaluated through a simulation comparison. Implications for the natural history of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) were assessed using data from SeizureTracker.com. Results: EpiSAT led to significant improvement in seizure risk assessment compared to traditional approaches relying solely on observed seizure frequencies. Applied to TSC, four underlying seizure risk states were identified. The expected duration of each state was {\textless}12 months, providing a data-driven estimate of the amount of time a person with TSC would be expected to remain at the same seizure risk level according to the natural course of epilepsy. Significance: We propose a novel Bayesian statistical approach for evaluating seizure risk on an individual patient level using patient-reported seizure diaries, which allows for the incorporation of external clinical variables to assess impact on seizure risk. This tool may improve the ability to distinguish true changes in seizure risk from natural variations in seizure frequency in clinical practice. Incorporation of systematic statistical approaches into antiepileptic drug (AED) management may help improve understanding of seizure unpredictability as well as timing of treatment interventions for people with epilepsy.},

Still, this strategy requires a sufficient number of labeled examples. Moreover, we need to train new classifiers when there is a change in the set of behaviors that we consider or in the manifestation of these behaviors in video. Consequently, there is a need for an efficient way to annotate rodent behaviors. In this paper we introduce a framework for interactive behavior annotation in video based on active learning. By putting a human in the loop, we alternate between learning and labeling. We apply the framework to three rodent behavior datasets and show that we can train accurate behavior classifiers with a strongly reduced number of labeled samples. We confirm the efficacy of the tool in a user study demonstrating that interactive annotation facilitates efficient, high-quality behavior measurements in practice.},

	abstract = {Background: Social behavior is an important aspect of rodent models. Automated measuring tools that make use of video analysis and machine learning are an increasingly attractive alternative to manual annotation. Because machine learning-based methods need to be trained, it is important that they are validated using data from different experiment settings. New method: To develop and validate automated measuring tools, there is a need for annotated rodent interaction datasets. Currently, the availability of such datasets is limited to two mouse datasets. We introduce the first, publicly available rat social interaction dataset, RatSI. Results: We demonstrate the practical value of the novel dataset by using it as the training set for a rat interaction recognition method. We show that behavior variations induced by the experiment setting can lead to reduced performance, which illustrates the importance of cross-dataset validation. Consequently, we add a simple adaptation step to our method and improve the recognition performance. Comparison with existing methods: Most existing methods are trained and evaluated in one experimental setting, which limits the predictive power of the evaluation to that particular setting. We demonstrate that cross-dataset experiments provide more insight in the performance of classifiers. Conclusions: With our novel, public dataset we encourage the development and validation of automated recognition methods. We are convinced that cross-dataset validation enhances our understanding of rodent interactions and facilitates the development of more sophisticated recognition methods. Combining them with adaptation techniques may enable us to apply automated recognition methods to a variety of animals and experiment settings.},

	abstract = {The study of the fine-grained social dynamics between children is a methodological challenge, yet a good understanding of how social interaction between children unfolds is important not only to Developmental and Social Psychology, but recently has become relevant to the neighbouring field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Indeed, child-robot interactions are increasingly being explored in domains which require longer-term interactions, such as healthcare and education. For a robot to behave in an appropriate manner over longer time scales, its behaviours have to be contingent and meaningful to the unfolding relationship. Recognising, interpreting and generating sustained and engaging social behaviours is as such an important-and essentially, open-research question. We believe that the recent progress of machine learning opens new opportunities in terms of both analysis and synthesis of complex social dynamics. To support these approaches, we introduce in this article a novel, open dataset of child social interactions, designed with data-driven research methodologies in mind. Our data acquisition methodology relies on an engaging, methodologically sound, but purposefully underspecified free-play interaction. By doing so, we capture a rich set of behavioural patterns occurring in natural social interactions between children. The resulting dataset, called the PInSoRo dataset, comprises 45+ hours of hand-coded recordings of social interactions between 45 child-child pairs and 30 child-robot pairs. In addition to annotations of social constructs, the dataset includes fully calibrated video recordings, 3D recordings of the faces, skeletal informations, full audio recordings, as well as game interactions.},

The Continuously Annotated Signals of Emotion (CASE) dataset provides a solution as it focusses on real-time continuous annotation of emotions, as experienced by the participants, while watching various videos. For this purpose, a novel, intuitive joystick-based annotation interface was developed, that allowed for simultaneous reporting of valence and arousal, that are instead often annotated independently. In parallel, eight high quality, synchronized physiological recordings (1000 Hz, 16-bit ADC) were obtained from ECG, BVP, EMG (3x), GSR (or EDA), respiration and skin temperature sensors. The dataset consists of the physiological and annotation data from 30 participants, 15 male and 15 female, who watched several validated video-stimuli. The validity of the emotion induction, as exemplified by the annotation and physiological data, is also presented.},

If not captured, these changes might lead to invalid inferences about the constructs. Existing methodology can only test for a priori hypotheses on MM changes, which are often absent or incomplete. Therefore, we present the exploratory method “latent Markov factor analysis” (LMFA), wherein a latent Markov chain captures MM changes by clustering observations per subject into a few states. Specifically, each state gathers validly comparable observations, and state-specific factor analyses reveal what the MMs look like. LMFA performs well in recovering parameters under a wide range of simulated conditions, and its empirical value is illustrated with an example.},

The class of hidden Markov models (HMMs) matches the intuitive understanding that animal movement is driven by underlying behavioural modes and has proven to be very useful for analysing movement data. For data that involve a regular sampling unit and negligible measurement error, these models usually are sufficiently flexible to capture the complex correlation structure found in movement data, yet are computationally inexpensive compared to alternative methods. The R package moveHMM allows ecologists to process GPS tracking data into series of step lengths and turning angles, and to fit an HMM to these data, allowing, in particular, for the incorporation of environmental covariates. The package includes assessment and visualization tools for the fitted model. We illustrate the use of moveHMM using (simulated) movement of the legendary wild haggis Haggis scoticus. Our findings illustrate the role our software, and movement modelling in general, can play in conservation and management by illuminating environmental constraints.},

The pathology of Alzheimer’s disease usually evolves from cognitive normal, to mild cognitive impairment, to Alzheimer’s disease. The aim of this paper is to develop a Bayesian hidden Markov model to characterize disease pathology, identify hidden states corresponding to the diagnosed stages of cognitive decline, and examine the dynamic changes of potential risk factors associated with the cognitive normal–mild cognitive impairment–Alzheimer’s disease transition. The hidden Markov model framework consists of two major components. The first one is a state-dependent semiparametric regression for delineating the complex associations between clinical outcomes of interest and a set of prognostic biomarkers across neurodegenerative states. The second one is a parametric transition model, while accounting for potential covariate effects on the cross-state transition. The inter-individual and inter-process differences are taken into account via correlated random effects in both components. Based on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data set, we are able to identify four states of Alzheimer’s disease pathology, corresponding to common diagnosed cognitive decline stages, including cognitive normal, early mild cognitive impairment, late mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer’s disease and examine the effects of hippocampus, age, gender, and APOE-E4 on degeneration of cognitive function across the four cognitive states.},

Hidden Markov models are considered suitable for clustering purposes. Their clustering is well studied, however, only if the observable variables can be assumed to be Gaussian mixtures, which is not valid in our case. Therefore, we use the Kullback-Leibler divergence to cluster hidden Markov models with observable variables that have an arbitrary distribution. Hierarchical and spectral clustering is applied. To evaluate the modeling approach, an experiment was performed and an accuracy of 83.86\% was reached in predicting behavioral sequences of individual animals. Results of clustering were evaluated by means of statistical descriptors of the animals and by a domain expert, both methods confirm that the results of clustering are meaningful.},

	abstract = {Movement has important consequences for individual and population-level processes, but methods are only starting to become available for quantifying fine-scale movement paths of smaller animals. New techniques for inferring behavioral states and their relation to social and environmental factors provide a powerful way to test the influence of such factors on individuals. One such technique that has recently gained popularity is the use of hidden Markov models, which link time series of movement variables and the underlying behavioral states of individuals. We used hidden Markov models to evaluate behavioral states and their relation to environmental, seasonal, and social factors in the cooperatively breeding red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) while accounting for individual heterogeneity with discrete random effects. We identified 2 distinct behavioral states, resting and foraging, which were related to covariates in our models. Using this approach, we concluded that woodpecker step lengths tended to be longest in winter, larger groups of woodpeckers tended to spend less time foraging and more time resting when compared with smaller groups, and woodpeckers foraged more and rested less when in higher-quality habitat. Our results demonstrate the impact that social and environmental factors can have on movement in a social species and, thus, reinforce the importance of including these factors in animal movement studies. The extensions of basic hidden Markov models considered here may prove valuable in forthcoming studies that involve highresolution tracking to understand behavior of birds and other small animals.},

This paper presents an autoregressive GLMM with crossed random effects that accounts for variability in lag effects across persons and items. The model is shown to be applicable to intensive binary time series eye-tracking data when researchers are interested in detecting experimental condition effects while controlling for previous responses.

In order to avoid bias when using a model of this type in the presence of informative drop-out, we propose an event-history (EH) extension of the latent Markov approach that may be used with multivariate longitudinal data, in which one or more outcomes of a different nature are observed at each time occasion. The EH component of the resulting model is referred to the interval-censored drop-out, and bias in MLM modeling is avoided by correlated random effects, included in the different model components, which follow common latent distributions. In order to perform maximum likelihood estimation of the proposed model by the expectation-maximization algorithm, we extend the usual forward-backward recursions of Baum and Welch. The algorithm has the same complexity as the one adopted in cases of non-informative drop-out. We illustrate the proposed approach through simulations and an application based on data coming from a medical study about primary biliary cirrhosis in which there are two outcomes of interest, one continuous and the other binary.},

The proposal can be viewed as an extension of hidden Markov regression models with fixed covariates (HMRMFCs), which is the state of the art for modelling longitudinal data, with a special focus on the underlying clustering structure. HMRMFCs are inadequate for applications in which a clustering structure can be identified in the distribution of the covariates, as the clustering is independent from the covariates distribution. Here, hidden Markov regression models with random covariates are introduced by explicitly specifying state-specific distributions for the covariates, with the aim of improving the recovering of the clusters in the data with respect to a fixed covariates paradigm. The hidden Markov regression models with random covariates class is defined focusing on the exponential family, in a generalized linear model framework. Model identifiability conditions are sketched, an expectation-maximization algorithm is outlined for parameter estimation, and various implementation and operational issues are discussed. Properties of the estimators of the regression coefficients, as well as of the hidden path parameters, are evaluated through simulation experiments and compared with those of HMRMFCs.

We show that an extension of these models to mixed effects models is straightforward in a population context. We then show how the forward–backward algorithm used for inference in hidden Markov models and the extended Kalman filter used for inference in diffusion models can be combined with standard inference algorithms in mixed effects models for estimating the parameters of the model.

Bayesian modelling of rainfall data by using non-homogeneous hidden Markov models and latent Gaussian variables. Summary. We present a non-homogeneous hidden Markov model (NHMM) for the spatio-temporal analysis of rainfall data, within a subjective Bayesian framework. In this model, daily rainfall patterns are driven by a small number of unobserved states, interpreted as states of the weather, that evolve in time according to a first order non-homogeneous Markov chain, with transition probabilities dependent upon time-varying atmospheric data. The weather states alone do not account for all the space time structure in the data and so we introduce latent multivariate normal random variables in a flexible model for the probability of rain and the distribution of non-zero rainfall amounts. In the resulting hierarchical NHMM, rainfall occurrences and non-zero rainfall amounts are spatially dependent and conditionally Markov in time, given the weather state. We build a prior distribution that conveys genuine initial beliefs and apply the model and inferential procedures to data from a network of twelve sites located throughout the UK.},

This is partially due to the fact that comprehensive statistics for model selection and model assessment are lacking in the psychological literature. We present model selection and model assessment statistics that are particularly useful in applying hidden Markov models in psychology. These statistics are presented and evaluated by simulation studies for a toy example. We compare AIC, BIC and related criteria and introduce a prediction error measure for assessing goodness-of-fit. In a simulation study, two methods of fitting equality constraints are compared. In two illustrative examples with experimental data we apply selection criteria, fit models with constraints and assess goodness-of-fit. First, data from a concept identification task is analyzed. Hidden Markov models provide a flexible approach to analyzing such data when compared to other modeling methods. Second, a novel application of hidden Markov models in implicit learning is presented. Hidden Markov models are used in this context to quantify knowledge that subjects express in an implicit learning task. This method of analyzing implicit learning data provides a comprehensive approach for addressing important theoretical issues in the field.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

EMA aims to minimize recall bias, maximize ecological validity, and allow study of microprocesses that influence behavior in real-world contexts. EMA studies assess particular events in subjects' lives or assess subjects at periodic intervals, often by random time sampling, using technologies ranging from written diaries and telephones to electronic diaries and physiological sensors.

Previous work has primarily focused on continuous outcomes and little attention has been paid to count outcomes. The estimation of count outcome models can be difficult because the likelihood has no closed-form solution, meaning that approximation methods are required. Although adaptive Gaussian quadrature (AGQ) is generally seen as the gold standard, its comparative performance has been investigated with larger samples. AGQ approximates the full likelihood, a function that is known to produce biased estimates with small samples with continuous outcomes. Conversely, penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) is considered to be a less desirable approximation; however, it can approximate the restricted likelihood function, a function that is known to perform well with smaller samples with continuous outcomes. The goal of this paper is to compare the small sample bias of full likelihood methods to the linearization bias of PQL with restricted likelihood. Simulation results indicate that the linearization bias of PQL is preferable to the finite sample bias of AGQ with smaller samples.},

	abstract = {When comparing multilevel models (MLMs) differing in fixed and/or random effects, researchers have had continuing interest in using R-squared differences to communicate effect size and importance of included terms. However, there has been longstanding confusion regarding which R-squared difference measures should be used for which kind of MLM comparisons. Furthermore, several limitations of recent studies on R-squared differences in MLM have led to misleading or incomplete recommendations for practice. These limitations include computing measures that are by definition incapable of detecting a particular type of added term, considering only a subset of the broader class of available R-squared difference measures, and incorrectly defining what a given R-squared difference measure quantifies. The purpose of this paper is to elucidate and resolve these issues. To do so, we define a more general set of total, within-cluster, and between-cluster R-squared difference measures than previously considered in MLM comparisons and give researchers concrete step-by-step procedures for identifying which measure is relevant to which model comparison. We supply simulated and analytic demonstrations of limitations of previous MLM studies on R-squared differences and show how application of our step-by-step procedures and general set of measures overcomes each. Additionally, we provide and illustrate graphical tools and software allowing researchers to automatically compute and visualize our set of measures in an integrated manner. We conclude with recommendations, as well as extensions involving (a) how our framework relates to and can be used to obtain pseudo-R-squareds, and (b) how our framework can accommodate both simultaneous and hierarchical model-building approaches.},

We account for dependence between longitudinal responses from the same subject using time-varying random effects associated with a heterogeneous hidden Markov chain. As several participants in the study drop out prematurely, we introduce a further random effect model to describe the missing data mechanism. The potential dependence between the random effects in the two equations (and, therefore, between the two processes) is introduced through a joint distribution specified via a latent structure approach. The application of the proposal to data from the Leiden 85+ study shows its effectiveness in modeling heterogeneous longitudinal patterns, possibly influenced by the missing data process. Results from a sensitivity analysis show the robustness of the estimates with respect to misspecification of the missing data mechanism.

	abstract = {Cocaine is a type of drug that functions to increase the availability of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain. However, cocaine dependence or abuse is highly related to an increased risk of psychiatric disorders and deficits in cognitive performance, attention, and decision-making abilities. Given the chronic and persistent features of drug addiction, the progression of abstaining from cocaine often evolves across several states, such as addiction to, moderate dependence on, and swearing off cocaine. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are well suited to the characterization of longitudinal data in terms of a set of unobservable states, and have increasingly been used to uncover the dynamic heterogeneity in progressive diseases or activities. However, the existence of outliers or influential points may misidentify the hidden states and distort the associated inference. In this study, we develop a Bayesian local influence procedure for HMMs with latent variables in the presence of missing data. The proposed model enables us to investigate the dynamic heterogeneity of multivariate longitudinal data, reveal how the interrelationships among latent variables change from one state to another, and simultaneously conduct statistical diagnosis for the given data, model assumptions, and prior inputs. We apply the proposed procedure to analyze a dataset collected by the UCLA center for advancing longitudinal drug abuse research. Several outliers or influential points that seriously influence estimation results are identified and removed. The proposed procedure also discovers the effects of treatment and individuals’ psychological problems on cocaine use behavior and delineates their dynamic changes across the cocaine-addiction states.},

	abstract = {In single-case research, multiple-baseline (MB) design provides the opportunity to estimate the treatment effect based on not only within-series comparisons of treatment phase to baseline phase observations, but also time-specific between-series comparisons of observations from those that have started treatment to those that are still in the baseline. For analyzing MB studies, two types of linear mixed modeling methods have been proposed: the within- and between-series models. In principle, those models were developed based on normality assumptions, however, normality may not always be found in practical settings. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the robustness of the within- and between-series models when data were non-normal. A Monte Carlo study was conducted with four statistical approaches. The approaches were defined by the crossing of two analytic decisions: (a) whether to use a within- or between-series estimate of effect and (b) whether to use restricted maximum likelihood or Markov chain Monte Carlo estimations. The results showed the treatment effect estimates of the four approaches had minimal bias, that within-series estimates were more precise than between-series estimates, and that confidence interval coverage was frequently acceptable, but varied across conditions and methods of estimation. Applications and implications were discussed based on the findings.},

To test an indirect effect in a two-mediator model, we conducted a large-scale Monte Carlo simulation study of the Type I error, statistical power, and confidence interval coverage rates of 10 frequentist and Bayesian confidence/credible intervals (CIs) for normally and nonnormally distributed data. The simulation included never-studied methods and conditions (e.g., Bayesian CI with flat and weakly informative prior methods, two model-based bootstrap methods, and two nonnormality conditions) as well as understudied methods (e.g., profile-likelihood, Monte Carlo with maximum likelihood standard error [MC-ML] and robust standard error [MC-Robust]). The popular BC bootstrap showed inflated Type I error rates and CI under-coverage. We recommend different methods depending on the purpose of the analysis. For testing the null hypothesis of no mediation, we recommend MC-ML, profile-likelihood, and two Bayesian methods. To report a CI, if data has a multivariate normal distribution, we recommend MC-ML, profile-likelihood, and the two Bayesian methods; otherwise, for multivariate nonnormal data we recommend the percentile bootstrap. We argue that the best method for testing hypotheses is not necessarily the best method for CI construction, which is consistent with the findings we present.},

	abstract = {The latent Markov (LM) model is a popular method for identifying distinct unobserved states and transitions between these states over time in longitudinally observed responses. The bootstrap likelihood-ratio (BLR) test yields the most rigorous test for determining the number of latent states, yet little is known about power analysis for this test. Power could be computed as the proportion of the bootstrap p values (PBP) for which the null hypothesis is rejected. This requires performing the full bootstrap procedure for a large number of samples generated from the model under the alternative hypothesis, which is computationally infeasible in most situations. This article presents a computationally feasible shortcut method for power computation for the BLR test. The shortcut method involves the following simple steps: (1) obtaining the parameters of the model under the null hypothesis, (2) constructing the empirical distributions of the likelihood ratio under the null and alternative hypotheses via Monte Carlo simulations, and (3) using these empirical distributions to compute the power. We evaluate the performance of the shortcut method by comparing it to the PBP method and, moreover, show how the shortcut method can be used for sample-size determination.},

	abstract = {Literature addressing missing data handling for random coefficient models is particularly scant, and the few studies to date have focused on the fully conditional specification framework and “reverse random coefficient” imputation. Although it has not received much attention in the literature, a joint modeling strategy that uses random within-cluster covariance matrices to preserve cluster-specific associations is a promising alternative for random coefficient analyses. This study is apparently the first to directly compare these procedures. Analytic results suggest that both imputation procedures can introduce bias-inducing incompatibilities with a random coefficient analysis model. Problems with fully conditional specification result from an incorrect distributional assumption, whereas joint imputation uses an underparameterized model that assumes uncorrelated intercepts and slopes. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that biases from these issues are tolerable if the missing data rate is 10\% or lower and the sample is composed of at least 30 clusters with 15 observations per group. Furthermore, fully conditional specification tends to be superior with intraclass correlations that are typical of crosssectional data (e.g., ICC =.10), whereas the joint model is preferable with high values typical of longitudinal designs (e.g., ICC =.50).},

Models were fit to data generated from three-factor population structures that varied in factor loading magnitude, factor intercorrelation magnitude, number of indicators, and whether cross loadings or minor factors were included.

Yet, the search systems allowing access to this evidence provide varying levels of precision, recall, and reproducibility and also demand different levels of effort. To date, it remains unclear which search systems are most appropriate for evidence synthesis and why. Advice on which search engines and bibliographic databases to choose for systematic searches is limited and lacking systematic, empirical performance assessments. This study investigates and compares the systematic search qualities of 28 widely used academic search systems, including Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science. A novel, query-based method tests how well users are able to interact and retrieve records with each system. The study is the first to show the extent to which search systems can effectively and efficiently perform (Boolean) searches with regards to precision, recall, and reproducibility. We found substantial differences in the performance of search systems, meaning that their usability in systematic searches varies. Indeed, only half of the search systems analyzed and only a few Open Access databases can be recommended for evidence syntheses without adding substantial caveats. Particularly, our findings demonstrate why Google Scholar is inappropriate as principal search system. We call for database owners to recognize the requirements of evidence synthesis and for academic journals to reassess quality requirements for systematic reviews. Our findings aim to support researchers in conducting better searches for better evidence synthesis.},

	url = {www.ai.mit.edu/%E2%88%BCmurphyk},
	abstract = {A semi-Markov HMM is like an HMM except each state can emit a sequence of observations. In this paper, we provide a unified review of inference and learning in a variety of different kinds of semi-Markov HMMs, including explicit-duration HMMs, segment HMMs, and multigrams. We also discuss some important implementation details, such as avoiding underflow, which are often glossed over. A semi-Markov HMM (more properly called a hidden semi-Markov model, or HSMM) is like an HMM except each state can emit a sequence of observations. Let Y (G t) be the subsequence emitted by "generalized state" G t. The "generalized state" usually contains both the automaton state, Q t , and the length (duration) of the segment, L t. We will define Y (G t) to be the subsequence y t−l+1:t. After emitting a segment, the next state is G tn , where t n = t + L t. Similarly, denote the previous state by G tp. Let Y (G + t) be all observations following G t , and Y (G − t) be all observations preceeding G t , as in Figure 1. Each segment O t (q, l) def = P (Y (G t){\textbar}Q t = q, L t = l) can be an arbitrary distribution. If P (Y (G t){\textbar}q, l) = t i=t−l+1 P (y i {\textbar}q), this is an explicit duration HMM [Fer80, Lev86, Rab89, MJ93, MHJ95]. If P (Y (G t){\textbar}q, l) is modelled by an HMM or state-space model (linear-dynamical system), this is called a segment model [GY93, ODK96]. In computational biology, P (Y (G t){\textbar}q, l) is often modelled by a weight matrix or higher-order Markov chain (see e.g., [BK97]). In this paper, we are agnostic about the form of P (Y (G t){\textbar}q, l). It is possible to approximate a variable-duration HMM by adding extra states to a regular HMM (see [DEKM98, p69]), i.e., a mixture of geometric distributions. However, our main interest will be segment models, which are strict generalizations of variable-duration HMMs. For the relationship between semi-Markov HMMs, pseudo-2D HMMs, hierarchical HMMs, etc., please see [Mur02]. (Essentially, with a pseudo-2D HMMs, we know the size of each segment ahead of time; an HHMM is a generalization of a segment model where each segment can have subsegments inside of it, each modelled by an HMM.) We can represent a variable-duration HMMs as a DBN as shown in FIgure 2. We explicitly add Q D t , the remaining duration of state Q t , to the state-space. (Even though Q t is constant for a long period, we copy its value across every Q t Q T Q t n Y(Q t) Y(Q-t) t Y(Q) + Q t p 1 Q Figure 1: A segment model.},

	abstract = {Neurons in vitro and in vivo have epochs of bursting or "up state" activity during which firing rates are dramatically elevated. Various methods of detecting bursts in extracellular spike trains have appeared in the literature, the most widely used apparently being Poisson Surprise (PS). A natural description of the phenomenon assumes (1) there are two hidden states, which we label "burst" and "non-burst," (2) the neuron evolves stochastically, switching at random between these two states, and (3) within each state the spike train follows a time-homogeneous point process. If in (2) the transitions from non-burst to burst and burst to non-burst states are memoryless, this becomes a hidden Markov model (HMM). For HMMs, the state transitions follow exponential distributions, and are highly irregular. Because observed bursting may in some cases be fairly regular-exhibiting inter-burst intervals with small variation-we relaxed this assumption. When more general probability distributions are used to describe the state transitions the two-state point process model becomes a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM). We developed an efficient Bayesian computational scheme to fit HSMMs to spike train data. Numerical simulations indicate the method can perform well, sometimes yielding very different results than those based on PS. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Bayesian nonparametric methods have recently transformed emerging areas within data science. One such promising method, the infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM), generalizes the HMM that itself has become a workhorse in single molecule data analysis. The iHMM goes beyond the HMM by self-consistently learning all parameters learned by the HMM in addition to learning the number of states without recourse to any model selection steps. Despite its generality, simple features (such as drift), common to single molecule time traces, result in an overinterpretation of drift and the introduction of artifact states. Here we present an adaptation of the iHMM that can treat data with drift originating from one or many traces (e.g., Förster resonance energy transfer). Our fully Bayesian method couples the iHMM to a continuous control process (drift) self-consistently learned while learning all other quantities determined by the iHMM (including state numbers). A key advantage of this method is that all traces—regardless of drift or states visited across traces—may now be treated on an equal footing, thereby eliminating user-dependent trace selection (based on drift levels), preprocessing to remove drift, and postprocessing model selection based on state number.},

	abstract = {In a 1970 Biometrika paper, W. K. Hastings developed a broad class of Markov chain algorithms for sampling from probability distributions that are difficult to sample from directly. The algorithm draws a candidate value from a proposal distribution and accepts the candidate with a probability that can be computed using only the unnormalized density of the target distribution, allowing one to sample from distributions known only up to a constant of proportionality. The stationary distribution of the corresponding Markov chain is the target distribution one is attempting to sample from. The Hastings algorithm generalizes the Metropolis algorithm to allow a much broader class of proposal distributions instead of just symmetric cases.An important class of applications for the Hastings algorithm corresponds to sampling from Bayesian posterior distributions, which have densities given by a prior density multiplied by a likelihood function and divided by a normalizing constant equal to the marginal likelihood. The marginal likelihood is typically intractable, presenting a fundamental barrier to implementation in Bayesian statistics. This barrier can be overcome by Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithms. Amazingly, even after 50 years, the majority of algorithms used in practice today involve the Hastings algorithm. This article provides a brief celebration of the continuing impact of this ingenious algorithm on the 50th anniversary of its publication.},

This research compares random effects, zero inflated, and zero inflated random effects models using a full Bayes hierarchical approach. The models are compared not just in terms of goodness-of-fit measures but also in terms of precision of posterior crash frequency estimates since the precision of these estimates is vital for ranking of sites for engineering improvement. Fixed-over-time random effects models are also compared to independent-over-time random effects models. For the crash dataset being analyzed, it was found that once the random effects are included in the zero inflated models, the probability of being in the zero state is drastically reduced, and the zero inflated models degenerate to their non zero inflated counterparts. Also by fixing the random effects over time the fit of the models and the precision of the crash frequency estimates are significantly increased. It was found that the rankings of the fixed-over-time random effects models are very consistent among them. In addition, the results show that by fixing the random effects over time, the standard errors of the crash frequency estimates are significantly reduced for the majority of the segments on the top of the ranking. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Suppose we observe Y, YN, where Y, has the exponential density f(y, I 0,) = exp\{ J[y,O,-b(0,)]\}c(y,, 4,). The paramete of interest are not the canonical parameters 0, but the means ,u, = b'(O,). In the usual generalized linear model (GLM) setup, suppose the means pi,. .-, AN are believed to satisfy a specific p-dimensional GLM g(,u,) = xT[J, where the link function g and the regression coefficients \{x,\} are known and the regression vector JJ is unknown. Two problems of interest are the assessment of the goodness of fit of the GLM and the estimation of the means u,. The approach to these problems is by the use of a Bayesian two-stage prior distribution, a generalization of a model used by Lindley and Smith (1972) in the normal mean-estimation problem. At the first stage of the model, we assign independent conjugate distributions to 0,,. . ., ON,where the prior means of the ,u, satisfy the GLM. There are p + 1 unknown hyperparameters in this specification, the elements of the regression parameter JJ and a precision parameter A. At the second stage of the prior model, the hyperparameters JJ and A are assigned noninformative distributions. The posterior distribution for the 0, is expressible as r(\{f,\} I data) = f 7t(\{,\} I data, fJ, A))i(f, A I data) d/B dA. The posterior distribution of the 0, given the hyperparameters JJ and A is tractable, but the posterior distribution of JJ and A is intractable. The focus of this article is on tractable accurate approximations to the posterior distribution of J and A. These approximations give simple expressions for posterior moments of the hyperparameters A and JJ and for posterior moments of the means ,u,. The accuracy of the approximate methods is investigated for binomial data in which the means are believed to satisfy a logistic model. A thorough evaluation of the methods is made for the simple exchangeable model. A more complicated logistic model is fit to data from Rosenberg (1962), and the usual frequentist inferences and inferences using the Bayesian hierarchical model are illustrated.},

In this study, we propose a generative framework, based on a hidden Markov model (HMM), for using eye-tracking data to analyze behavior in the context of multiple moving objects of interest. We apply this framework to analyze data from a recent visual object tracking task paradigm, TrackIt, for studying selective sustained attention in children. Within this paradigm, we present two validation experiments to show that the HMM provides a viable approach to studying eye-tracking data with moving stimuli, and to illustrate the benefits of the HMM approach over some more naive possible approaches. The first experiment utilizes a novel ‘supervised’ variant of TrackIt, while the second compares directly with judgments made by human coders using data from the original TrackIt task. Our results suggest that the HMM-based method provides a robust analysis of eye-tracking data with moving stimuli, both for adults and for children as young as 3.5–6 years old.},

Hidden Markov models (HMMs) that include individual-level random effects have re-2 cently been promoted for inferring animal movement behaviour from biotelemetry data. 3 These "mixed HMMs" come at significant cost in terms of implementation and com-4 putation, and discrete random effects have been advocated as a practical alternative to 5 more computationally-intensive continuous random effects. However, the performance 6 of mixed HMMs has not yet been sufficiently explored to justify their widespread adop-7 tion, and there is currently little guidance for practitioners weighing the costs and 8 benefits of mixed HMMs for a particular research objective. 9 2. We performed an extensive simulation study comparing the performance of a suite of 10 fixed and random effect models for individual heterogeneity in the hidden state process 11 of a 2-state HMM. We focused on sampling scenarios more typical of telemetry studies, 12 which often consist of relatively long time series (30 − 250 observations per animal) for 13 relatively few individuals (5 − 100 animals). 14 3.

Continuous random effect models were fairly 17 robust to data generated under discrete random effects, but not vice versa.

It is anticipated that comparison of the crash estimation results of the five models would identify the impact of varied random effects on the HSID. The data over a ten year time period (2003–2012) were selected for analysis of a total 137 intersections in the City of Corona, California. The crash types collected in this study include: Rear-end, Head-on, Side-swipe, Broad-side, Hit object, and Others. Statistically significant correlations among crash outcomes for the heterogeneity error term were observed which clearly demonstrated their multivariate nature. Additionally, the spatial random effects revealed the correlations among neighboring intersections across crash types. Five cross-validation criteria which contains, Residual Sum of Squares, Kappa, Mean Absolute Deviation, Method Consistency Test, and Total Rank Difference, were applied to assess the performance of the five HSID methods at crash estimation. In terms of accumulated results which combined all crash types, the model with spatial random effects consistently outperformed the other competing models with a significant margin.

	abstract = {Numerous efforts have been devoted to investigating crash occurrence as related to roadway design features, environmental factors and traffic conditions. However, most of the research has relied on univariate count models; that is, traffic crash counts at different levels of severity are estimated separately, which may neglect shared information in unobserved error terms, reduce efficiency in parameter estimates, and lead to potential biases in sample databases. This paper offers a multivariate Poisson-lognormal (MVPLN) specification that simultaneously models crash counts by injury severity. The MVPLN specification allows for a more general correlation structure as well as overdispersion. This approach addresses several questions that are difficult to answer when estimating crash counts separately. Thanks to recent advances in crash modeling and Bayesian statistics, parameter estimation is done within the Bayesian paradigm, using a Gibbs Sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithms for crashes on Washington State rural two-lane highways. Estimation results from the MVPLN approach show statistically significant correlations between crash counts at different levels of injury severity. The non-zero diagonal elements suggest overdispersion in crash counts at all levels of severity. The results lend themselves to several recommendations for highway safety treatments and design policies. For example, wide lanes and shoulders are key for reducing crash frequencies, as are longer vertical curves. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Gene network inference from transcriptomic data is an important methodological challenge and a key aspect of systems biology. Although several methods have been proposed to infer networks from microarray data, there is a need for inference methods able to model RNA-seq data, which are count-based and highly variable. In this work we propose a hierarchical Poisson log-normal model with a Lasso penalty to infer gene networks from RNA-seq data; this model has the advantage of directly modelling discrete data and accounting for inter-sample variance larger than the sample mean. Using real microRNA-seq data from breast cancer tumors and simulations, we compare this method to a regularized Gaussian graphical model on log-transformed data, and a Poisson log-linear graphical model with a Lasso penalty on power-transformed data. For data simulated with large inter-sample dispersion, the proposed model performs better than the other methods in terms of sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve. These results show the necessity of methods specifically designed for gene network inference from RNA-seq data. © 2013 Gallopin et al.},

For this reason, in this study we propose a multiple-trait and multiple-environment model for count data. The proposed model was developed under the Bayesian paradigm for which we developed a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with noninformative priors. This allows obtaining all required full conditional distributions of the parameters leading to an exact Gibbs sampler for the posterior distribution. Our model was tested with simulated data and a real data set. Results show that the proposed multi-trait, multi-environment model is an attractive alternative for modeling multiple count traits measured in multiple environments.},

When many covariates are available it is worthwhile selecting the subsets of variables which might affect most each row of the transition matrices. A Bayesian method for the stochastic selection of subsets of covariates is proposed by developing a novel evolutionary Monte Carlo algorithm.

	abstract = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are frequently used to analyse longitudinal data, where the same set of subjects is repeatedly observed over time. In this context, several sources of heterogeneity may arise at individual and/or time level, which affect the hidden process, that is, the transition probabilities between the hidden states. In this paper, we propose the use of a finite mixture of non-homogeneous HMMs (NH-HMMs) to face the heterogeneity problem. The non-homogeneity of the model allows us to take into account observed sources of heterogeneity by means of a proper set of covariates, time and/or individual dependent, explaining the variations in the transition probabilities. Moreover, we handle the unobserved sources of heterogeneity at the individual level, due to, for example, omitted covariates, by introducing a random term with a discrete distribution. The resulting model is a finite mixture of NH-HMM that can be used to classify individuals according to their dynamic behaviour or to estimate a mixed NH-HMM without any assumption regarding the distribution of the random term following the non-parametric maximum likelihood approach. We test the effectiveness of the proposal through a simulation study and an application to real data on alcohol abuse. © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Current methods in movement ecology focus on behavior as a driver of movement mechanisms. Our Markov model is a flexible and efficient method for inference related to effects on behavior that considers dependence between current and past behaviors. We applied this model to behavior data from six greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons frontalis) during spring migration in mid-continent North America and considered likely drivers of behavior, including habitat , weather and time of day effects. We modeled the transitions between flying, feeding, stationary and walking behavior states using a first-order Bayesian Markov model. We introduced Pólya-Gamma latent variables for automatic sampling of the covariate coefficients from the posterior distribution, and we calculated the odds ratios from the posterior samples. Our model provides a unifying framework for including both acceleration and Global Positioning System data. We found significant differences in behavioral transition rates among habitat types, diurnal behavior and behavioral changes due to weather. Our model provides straightforward inference of behavioral time allocation across used habitats, which is not amenable in activity budget or resource selection frameworks.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We study the Bitcoin and Ether price series under a financial perspective. Specifically, we use two econometric models to perform a two-layer analysis to study the correlation and prediction of Bitcoin and Ether price series with traditional assets. In the first part of this study, we model the probability of positive returns via a Bayesian logistic model. Even though the fitting performance of the logistic model is poor, we find that traditional assets can explain some of the variability of the price returns. Along with the fact that standard models fail to capture the statistic and econometric attributes—such as extreme variability and heteroskedasticity—of cryptocurrencies, this motivates us to apply a novel Non-Homogeneous Hidden Markov model to these series. In particular, we model Bitcoin and Ether prices via the non-homogeneous Pólya-Gamma Hidden Markov (NHPG) model, since it has been shown that it outperforms its counterparts in conventional financial data. The transition probabilities of the underlying hidden process are modeled via a logistic link whereas the observed series follow a mixture of normal regressions conditionally on the hidden process. Our results show that the NHPG algorithm has good in-sample performance and captures the heteroskedasticity of both series. It identifies frequent changes between the two states of the underlying Markov process. In what constitutes the most important implication of our study, we show that there exist linear correlations between the covariates and the ETH and BTC series. However, only the ETH series are affected non-linearly by a subset of the accounted covariates. Finally, we conclude that the large number of significant predictors along with the weak degree of predictability performance of the algorithm back up earlier findings that cryptocurrencies are unlike any other financial assets and predicting the cryptocurrency price series is still a challenging task. These findings can be useful to investors, policy makers, traders for portfolio allocation, risk management and trading strategies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Given a set of predictors, the time series are modeled via predictive regressions with state-dependent coefficients and time-varying transition probabilities that depend on the predictors via a logistic/multinomial function. In a hidden Markov setting, inference for logistic regression coefficients becomes complicated and in some cases impossible due to convergence issues. In this paper, we aim to address this problem utilizing the recently proposed Pólya-Gamma latent variable scheme. Also, we allow for model uncertainty regarding the predictors that affect the series both linearly — in the mean — and non-linearly — in the transition matrix. Predictor selection and inference on the model parameters are based on an automatic Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme with reversible jump steps. Hence the proposed methodology can be used as a black box for predicting time series. Using simulation experiments, we illustrate the performance of our algorithm in various setups, in terms of mixing properties, model selection and predictive ability. An empirical study on realized volatility data shows that our methodology gives improved forecasts compared to benchmark models.},

	abstract = {In many complex water supply systems, the next generation of water resources planning models will require simultaneous probabilistic streamflow inputs at multiple locations on an interconnected network. To make use of the valuable multicentury records provided by tree-ring data, reconstruction models must be able to produce appropriate multisite inputs. Existing streamflow reconstruction models typically focus on one site at a time, not addressing intersite dependencies and potentially misrepresenting uncertainty. To this end, we develop a model for multisite streamflow reconstruction with the ability to capture intersite correlations. The proposed model is a hierarchical Bayesian nonhomogeneous hidden Markov model (NHMM). A NHMM is fit to contemporary streamflow at each location using lognormal component distributions. Leading principal components of tree rings are used as covariates to model nonstationary transition probabilities and the parameters of the lognormal component distributions. Spatial dependence between sites is captured with a Gaussian elliptical copula. Parameters of the model are estimated in a fully Bayesian framework, in that marginal posterior distributions of all the parameters are obtained. The model is applied to reconstruct flows at 20 sites in the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) from 1473 to 1906. Many previous reconstructions are available for this basin, making it ideal for testing this new method. The results show some improvements over regression-based methods in terms of validation statistics. Key advantages of the Bayesian NHMM over traditional approaches are a dynamic representation of uncertainty and the ability to make long multisite simulations that capture at-site statistics and spatial correlations between sites.},

	abstract = {The automatic detection of heartbeats within physiological signals collected from patients connected to bedside monitors is an important task as it allows the detection of pathological conditions. Heartbeat detection is traditionally performed using the ECG. However, all bedside monitors are prone to missing data, yet it is rare for any system to incorporate data from other cardiac signals, such as the arterial blood pressure (ABP) or photoplethysmogram waveforms. This paper discusses the development of an automatic heartbeat detector using multimodal data from bedside monitors for the Physionet/Computing in Cardiol-ogy Challenge 2014. The presented algorithm employs an extended hidden Markov model to identify beat locations from multimodal data. The model was extended to include F1-score based signal quality indices in order to identify noisy periods. Wavelet transform features from both the ECG and ABP signals were added to derive the probability of a beat being present at a given location. The overall score of the algorithm for the third phase of the Phy-sionet Challenge 2014 was 83.47\%. The algorithm was also evaluated and compared to the top ranked entries [1] on a sample of 5150 synchronous ECG and ABP records from the MGH/MF database [2].

Since the 1860s scientists have used different methods to identify processing stages, usually based on reaction time (RT) differences between conditions. To overcome the limitations of RT-based methods we used hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs) to analyze EEG data. This HSMM-EEG methodology can identify stages of processing and how they vary with experimental condition. By combining this information with the brain signatures of the identified stages one can infer their function, and deduce underlying cognitive processes. To demonstrate the method we applied it to an associative recognition task. The stage-discovery method indicated that three major processes play a role in associative recognition: a familiarity process, an associative retrieval process, and a decision process. We conclude that the new stage-discovery method can provide valuable insight into human information processing.},

	abstract = {Sequential data modeling and analysis have become indispensable tools for analyzing sequential data, such as time-series data, because larger amounts of sensed event data have become available. These methods capture the sequential structure of data of interest, such as input-output relations and correlation among datasets. However, because most studies in this area are specialized or limited to their respective applications, rigorous requirement analysis of such models has not been undertaken from a general perspective. Therefore, we particularly examine the structure of sequential data, and extract the necessity of "state duration" and "state interval" of events for efficient and rich representation of sequential data. Specifically addressing the hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) that represents such state duration inside a model, we attempt to add representational capability of a state interval of events onto HSMM. To this end, we propose two extended models: an interval state hidden semi-Markov model (IS-HSMM) to express the length of a state interval with a special state node designated as "interval state node"; and an interval length probability hidden semi-Markov model (ILP-HSMM) which represents the length of the state interval with a new probabilistic parameter "interval length probability." Exhaustive simulations have revealed superior performance of the proposed models in comparison with HSMM. These proposed models are the first reported extensions of HMM to support state interval representation as well as state duration representation.},

Our models are developed under hidden Markov and semi-Markov settings to describe the temporal evolution of returns, whereas the marginal distribution of returns is described by a mixture of multivariate leptokurtic-normal (LN) distributions. Compared to the normal distribution, the LN has an additional parameter governing excess kurtosis and this allows us a better fit to both the distributional and dynamic properties of daily returns. We outline an expectation maximization algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation which exploits recursions developed within the hidden semi-Markov literature. As an illustration, we provide an example based on the analysis of a bivariate time series of stock market returns.},

	abstract = {Neocortical neurons show UP-DOWN state (UDS) oscillations under a variety of conditions. These UDS have been extensively studied because of the insight they can yield into the functioning of cortical networks, and their proposed role in putative memory formation. A key element in these studies is determining the precise duration and timing of the UDS. These states are typically determined from the membrane potential of one or a small number of cells, which is often not sufficient to reliably estimate the state of an ensemble of neocortical neurons. The local field potential (LFP) provides an attractive method for determining the state of a patch of cortex with high spatio-temporal resolution; however current methods for inferring UDS from LFP signals lack the robustness and flexibility to be applicable when UDS properties may vary substantially within and across experiments. Here we present an explicit-duration hidden Markov model (EDHMM) framework that is sufficiently general to allow statistically principled inference of UDS from different types of signals (membrane potential, LFP, EEG), combinations of signals (e.g., multichannel LFP recordings) and signal features over long recordings where substantial non-stationarities are present. Using cortical LFPs recorded from urethane-anesthetized mice, we demonstrate that the proposed method allows robust inference of UDS. To illustrate the flexibility of the algorithm we show that it performs well on EEG recordings as well. We then validate these results using simultaneous recordings of the LFP and membrane potential (MP) of nearby cortical neurons, showing that our method offers significant improvements over standard methods. These results could be useful for determining functional connectivity of different brain regions, as well as understanding network dynamics. © 2011 McFarland et al.

Using extant data we developed a method of classifying and subsequently generating couple dynamics using a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden semi-Markov Model (HDP-HSMM). Our findings indicate that several key aspects of existing models of marital interaction are inadequate: affect state emissions and their durations, along with the expected variability differences between distressed and nondistressed couples are present but highly nuanced; and most surprisingly, heterogeneity among highly satisfied couples necessitate that they be divided into subgroups. We review how this unsupervised learning technique generates plausible dyadic sequences that are sensitive to relationship quality and provide a natural mechanism for computational models of behavioral and affective micro-social processes.},

To facilitate the computation of the proposed DD-HSMM methodology, new forward-backward algorithm is developed. The demonstration and evaluation of the proposed methodology is carried out through a case study.

Model performance is evaluated for station networks of summer rainfall over the Punjab region in northern India and Pakistan and the upper Yangtze River basin in south-central China. The model captures seasonality and the marginal daily distributions well in both regions. Extremes are reproduced relatively well in the Punjab region, but underestimated for the Yangtze. In terms of interannual variability, the combined GLM-HMM with spatiotemporal averages of observed rainfall as a predictor is shown to exhibit skill (in terms of reduced RMSE) at the station level, particularly for the Punjab region.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Context Direct observations of animals are the most reliable way to define their behavioural characteristics; however, to obtain these observations is costly and often logistically challenging. GPS tracking allows finer-scale interpretation of animal responses by measuring movement patterns; however, the true behaviour of the animal during the period of observation is seldom known. Aims The aim of our research was to draw behavioural inferences for a lioness with a hidden Markov model and to validate the predicted latent-state sequence with field observations of the lion pride. Methods We used hidden Markov models to model the movement of a lioness in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. A three-state log-normal model was selected as the most suitable model. The model outputs are related to collected data by using an observational model, such as, for example, a distribution for the average movement rate and/or direction of movement that depends on the underlying model states that are taken to represent behavioural states of the animal. These inferred behavioural states are validated against direct observation of the pride’s behaviour. Key results Average movement rate provided a useful alternative for the application of hidden Markov models to irregularly spaced GPS locations. The movement model predicted resting as the dominant activity throughout the day, with a peak in the afternoon. The local-movement state occurred consistently throughout the day, with a decreased proportion during the afternoon, when more resting takes place, and an increase towards the early evening. The relocating state had three peaks, namely, during mid-morning, early evening and about midnight. Because of the differences in timing of the direct observations and the GPS locations, we had to compare point observations of the true behaviour with an interval prediction of the modelled behavioural state. In 75\% of the cases, the model-predicted behaviour and the field-observed behaviour overlapped. Conclusions Our data suggest that the hidden Markov modelling approach is successful at predicting a realistic behaviour of lions on the basis of the GPS location coordinates and the average movement rate between locations. The present study provided a unique opportunity to uncover the hidden states and compare the true behaviour with the inferred behaviour from the predicted state sequence. Implications Our results illustrated the potential of using hidden Markov models with movement rate as an input to understand carnivore behavioural patterns that could inform conservation management practices.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Throughout the last two decades, Bayesian statistical methods have proliferated throughout ecology and evolution. Numerous previous references established both philosophical and computational guidelines for implementing Bayesian methods. However, protocols for incorporating prior information, the defining characteristic of Bayesian philosophy, are nearly nonexistent in the ecological literature. Here, I hope to encourage the use of weakly informative priors in ecology and evolution by providing a ‘consumer's guide’ to weakly informative priors. The first section outlines three reasons why ecologists should abandon noninformative priors: 1) common flat priors are not always noninformative, 2) noninformative priors provide the same result as simpler frequentist methods, and 3) noninformative priors suffer from the same high type I and type M error rates as frequentist methods. The second section provides a guide for implementing informative priors, wherein I detail convenient ‘reference’ prior distributions for common statistical models (i.e. regression, ANOVA, hierarchical models). I then use simulations to visually demonstrate how informative priors influence posterior parameter estimates. With the guidelines provided here, I hope to encourage the use of weakly informative priors for Bayesian analyses in ecology. Ecologists can and should debate the appropriate form of prior information, but should consider weakly informative priors as the new ‘default’ prior for any Bayesian model.},

Although there is mounting evidence that different hunting modes can cause opposing trophic cascades, there has been little focus on the modes used by top predators, especially those in the marine environment. Adult white sharks (Carcharhodon carcharias) are well known to forage on marine mammal prey, particularly pinnipeds. Sharks primarily ambush pinnipeds on the surface, but there has been less focus on the strategies they use to encounter prey. We applied mixed hidden Markov models to acoustic tracking data of white sharks in a coastal aggregation area in order to quantify changing movement states (area-restricted searching (ARS) vs. patrolling) and the factors that influenced them. Individuals were re-tracked over multiple days throughout a month to see whether state-switching dynamics varied or if individuals preferred certain movement strategies. Sharks were more likely to use ARS movements in the morning and during periods of chumming by ecotourism operators. Furthermore, the proportion of time individuals spent in the two different states and the state-switching frequency, differed between the sexes and between individuals. Predation attempts/success on pinnipeds were observed for sharks in both ARS and patrolling movement states and within all random effects groupings. Therefore, white sharks can use both a ‘sit-and-wait’ (ARS) and ‘active searching’ (patrolling) movements to ambush pinniped prey on the surface. White sharks demonstrate individual preferences for fine-scale movement patterns, which may be related to their use of different hunting modes. Marine top predators are generally assumed to use only one type of hunting mode, but we show that there may be a mix within populations. As such, individual variability should be considered when modelling behavioural effects of predators on prey species.},

	abstract = {Development and use of multistate mark-recapture models, which provide estimates of parameters of Markov processes in the face of imperfect detection, have become common over the last 20 years. Recently, estimating parameters of hidden Markov models, where the state of an individual can be uncertain even when it is detected, has received attention. Previous work has shown that ignoring state uncertainty biases estimates of survival and state transition probabilities, thereby reducing the power to detect effects. Efforts to adjust for state uncertainty have included special cases and a general framework for a single sample per period of interest. We provide a flexible framework for adjusting for state uncertainty in multistate models, while utilizing multiple sampling occasions per period of interest to increase precision and remove parameter redundancy. These models also produce direct estimates of state structure for each primary period, even for the case where there is just one sampling occasion. We apply our model to expected-value data, and to data from a study of Florida manatees, to provide examples of the improvement in precision due to secondary capture occasions. We have also implemented these models in program MARK. This general framework could also be used by practitioners to consider constrained models of particular interest, or to model the relationship between within-primary-period parameters (e.g., state structure) and between-primary-period parameters (e.g., state transition probabilities). © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

	abstract = {Background: Solar archival tags (henceforth called geolocators) are tracking devices deployed on animals to reconstruct their long-distance movements on the basis of locations inferred post hoc with reference to the geographical and seasonal variations in the timing and speeds of sunrise and sunset. The increased use of geolocators has created a need for analytical tools to produce accurate and objective estimates of migration routes that are explicit in their uncertainty about the position estimates. Results: We developed a hidden Markov chain model for the analysis of geolocator data. This model estimates tracks for animals with complex migratory behaviour by combining: (1) a shading-insensitive, template-fit physical model, (2) an uncorrelated random walk movement model that includes migratory and sedentary behavioural states, and (3) spatially explicit behavioural masks. The model is implemented in a specially developed open source R package FLightR. We used the particle filter (PF) algorithm to provide relatively fast model posterior computation. We illustrate our modelling approach with analysis of simulated data for stationary tags and of real tracks of both a tree swallow Tachycineta bicolor migrating along the east and a golden-crowned sparrow Zonotrichia atricapilla migrating along the west coast of North America. Conclusions: We provide a model that increases accuracy in analyses of noisy data and movements of animals with complicated migration behaviour. It provides posterior distributions for the positions of animals, their behavioural states (e.g., migrating or sedentary), and distance and direction of movement. Our approach allows biologists to estimate locations of animals with complex migratory behaviour based on raw light data. This model advances the current methods for estimating migration tracks from solar geolocation, and will benefit a fast-growing number of tracking studies with this technology.},

The model formulation accounts for inter-whale differences via a computationally efficient discrete random effect, and measures potential effects of experimental acoustic disturbance on between-state transition probabilities. We identify clear differences in blue whale disturbance response depending on the behavioural context during exposure, with whales less likely to initiate deep foraging behaviour during exposure. Findings are consistent with earlier studies using smaller samples, but the HMM approach provides a more nuanced characterization of behaviour changes.},

Two individual models were built for each driver, one trained from accelerator data and one learned from steering wheel angel data.

Hidden Markov models (HMM) are widely applied in precipitation simulation due to its simplicity and advancements in associated computing techniques. HMMs, however, lack the flexibility to accommodate external factors in the dynamics. In this study, we consider a novel semiparametric Bayesian non-homogeneous hidden Markov model (BNHMM) that can explicitly incorporate the effects of observed covariates, e.g., climate index, on the state transition probabilities as well as the observation emission distributions. The proposed approach is tested for three rainfall stations in the service area of Tampa Bay Water, a regional water supply agency in the Southeastern United States. The BNHMM is first examined to simulate historical monthly rainfall data from the period 1979 to 2016. It is then evaluated in a retrospective mode to generate 3-month-ahead precipitation forecasts. Results indicate that the proposed BNHMM can capture historical rainfall properties well, and it is a promising alternative in providing operational rainfall forecasts. Although large-scale atmospheric and oceanic teleconnections, e.g., ENSO, have a strong influence in regional rainfall at the seasonal time scale, especially for the winter and early spring; its influence on monthly scale rainfall is limited. Potential improvement in forecasting performance is also discussed.},

Most of the small residential solar PV systems are installed behind-the-meter making only the net load readings available to the utilities. This paper presents an unsupervised framework for joint disaggregation of the net load readings of a group of customers into the solar PV generation and electric load. Our algorithm synergistically combines a physical PV system performance model for individual solar PV generation estimation with a statistical model for joint load estimation. The electric load for a group of customers are estimated jointly by a mixed hidden Markov model (MHMM) which enables modeling the general load consumption behavior present in all customers while acknowledging the individual differences. At the same time, the new model can capture the change in load patterns over a time period by the hidden Markov states. The proposed algorithm is also capable of estimating the key technical parameters of the solar PV systems. Our proposed method is evaluated using net load, electric load, and solar PV generation data gathered from residential customers located in Austin, Texas.

The model allows marketers to reduce their direct mailing spending while controlling for potential negative effects on their sales. More specifically, we develop a model that captures the evolution of a consumer’s buying behavior over time across retail channels and compare our model to several other approaches. We find our model outperforms existing models including standard latent class models, including those belonging to the latent transition analysis framework. Using several criteria of model performance and fit, we find a hierarchical clustering structure in the data. Each cluster responds differentially to marketing activities.

Although high-performance tests are desirable, increased accuracy is frequently accompanied by a requirement for more elaborate infrastructure, which is often not feasible in the developing world. These challenges are pertinent to mapping, impact monitoring, and surveillance in trachoma elimination programs. To help inform rational design of diagnostics for trachoma elimination, we outline a nonparametric multilevel latent Markov modeling approach and apply it to 2 longitudinal cohort studies of trachoma-endemic communities in Tanzania (2000-2002) and The Gambia (2001-2002) to provide simultaneous inferences about the true population prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis infection and disease and the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of 3 diagnostic tests for C. trachomatis infection. Estimates were obtained by using data collected before and after mass azithromycin administration. Such estimates are particularly important for trachoma because of the absence of a true "gold standard" diagnostic test for C. trachomatis. Estimated transition probabilities provide useful insights into key epidemiologic questions about the persistence of disease and the clearance of infection as well as the required frequency of surveillance in the postelimination setting. © 2013 The Author.},

Toroidal clusters are defined by a class of bivariate von Mises densities, while skew-elliptical clusters are defined by mixed linear models with positive random effects.

	abstract = {A new hidden Markov model for the space-time evolution of daily rainfall is developed which models precipitation within hidden regional weather types by censored power-transformed Gaussian distributions. The latter provide flexible and interpretable multivariate models for the mixed discrete-continuous variables that describe both precipitation, when it occurs, and no precipitation. Parameter estimation is performed by using a Monte Carlo EM algorithm whose use and performance are evaluated by simulation studies. The model is fitted to rainfall data from a small network of stations in New Zealand encompassing a diverse range of orographic effects. The results that are obtained show that the marginal distributions and spatial structure of the data are well described by the fitted model which provides a better description of the spatial structure of precipitation than a standard hidden Markov model that is commonly used in the literature. However, the fitted model, like the standard hidden Markov model, cannot fully reproduce the local dynamics and underestimates the lag 1 auto-correlations. © 2009 Royal Statistical Society.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the statistical modeling of the latent dependence and co-movement structures of multivariate financial data using a new approach based on mixed factorial hidden Markov models, and their applications in Value-at-Risk (VaR) valuation. This approach combines hidden Markov Models (HMM) with mixed latent factor models. The HMM generates a piece-wise constant state evolution process and the observations are produced from the state vectors by a mixture of factor analyzers observation process. This new switching specification provides an alternative, compact, model to handle intra-frame correlation and unobserved heterogeneity in financial data. For maximum likelihood estimation we have proposed an iterative approach based on the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm. Using a set of historical data, from the Tunisian foreign exchange market, the model parameters are estimated. Then, the fitted model combined with a modified Monte-Carlo simulation algorithm was used to predict the VaR of the Tunisian public debt portfolio. Through a backtesting procedure, we found that this new specification exhibits a good fit to the data, improves the accuracy of VaR predictions and can avoid serious violations when a financial crisis occurs.},

The HHMM is an extension of the hidden Markov model (HMM) to include a hierarchy of the hidden states and composed of sub-HMMs in a hierarchical model, providing functionality beyond a hidden Markov models for modeling complex systems. We present efficient algorithms for detecting abnormal behaviors in a ubiquitous environment and learning both the parameters and the model structures. Algorithms to analyze the behavioral patterns of a user using the information provided by the user in a home network system. We propose the detecting of abnormal behavior algorithm, which builds profile based on the actions taken when the user enters a room. The main contributions of this paper lie in the application of the shared structure HHMM, the estimation of the state of a user's behavior, and the detection of abnormal behavior. Theuser behavior data from an experiment show that directly modeling shared structures improves the recognition efficiency and prediction accuracy for the state of a human's behavior when compared with a flat HMM. © 2013 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.},

The relationships among multiple items are captured by several common latent factors. The linear coregionalization method is adopted to model the temporal processes of latent variables. The merit of this modeling strategy lies in the fact that the processes among latent variables are nonseparate and codependent from each other. To account for possible heterogeneity and interrelationship among the longitudinal data, a hidden Markov model is introduced to model the transition probabilities across different latent states over time. The Monte Carlo expectation conditional maximization (MCECM) algorithm is developed to estimate unknown parameters in the proposed model. The Wald- and score-type statistics are proposed to test the related dependence of processes. A simulation study is conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed methodology. An example from a longitudinal study of cocaine use is taken to illustrate the proposed methodology.},

The binary caries experience outcomes are subject to misclassification. We modelled this misclassification process via a longitudinal latent continuous response subject to a measurement error process and showing a monotone behaviour. The baseline distributions of the unobservable continuous processes are defined as a function of the covariates through the specification of conditional distributions making use of the Markov property. In addition, random effects are considered to model the relationships among the multivariate responses. Our approach is in contrast with a previous approach working on the binary outcome scale. This method requires conditional independence of the possibly corrupted binary outcomes on the true binary outcomes. We assumed conditional independence on the latent scale, which is a weaker assumption than conditional independence on the binary scale. The aim of this article is therefore to show the properties of a model for a progressive longitudinal response with misclassification on the manifest scale but modelled on the latent scale. The model parameters are estimated in a Bayesian way using an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The model performance is shown through a simulation-based example, and the analysis of the motivating dataset is presented.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

For many tasks—including but not limited to systematic reviews and meta-analyses—the scientific literature needs to be checked systematically. Scholars and practitioners currently screen thousands of studies by hand to determine which studies to include in their review or meta-analysis. This is error prone and inefficient because of extremely imbalanced data: only a fraction of the screened studies is relevant. The future of systematic reviewing will be an interaction with machine learning algorithms to deal with the enormous increase of available text. We therefore developed an open source machine learning-aided pipeline applying active learning: ASReview. We demonstrate by means of simulation studies that active learning can yield far more efficient reviewing than manual reviewing while providing high quality. Furthermore, we describe the options of the free and open source research software and present the results from user experience tests.

The Global Oceanographic Data Center (GODAC) of the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) launched the Deep-sea Debris Database for public use in March 2017. The database archives photographs and videos of debris that have been collected since 1983 by deep-sea submersibles and remotely operated vehicles. From the 5010 dives in the database, 3425 man-made debris items were counted. More than 33\% of the debris was macro-plastic, of which 89\% was single-use products, and these ratios increased to 52\% and 92\%, respectively, in areas deeper than 6000 m. The deepest record was a plastic bag at 10898 m in the Mariana Trench. Deep-sea organisms were observed in the 17\% of plastic debris images, which include entanglement of plastic bags on chemosynthetic cold seep communities. Quantitative density analysis for the subset data in the western North Pacific showed plastic density ranging from 17 to 335 items km−2 at depths of 1092–5977 m. The data show that, in addition to resource exploitation and industrial development, the influence of land-based human activities has reached the deepest parts of the ocean in areas more than 1000 km from the mainland. Establishment of international frameworks on monitoring of deep-sea plastic pollution as an Essential Ocean Variable and a data sharing protocol are the keys to delivering scientific outcomes that are useful for the effective management of plastic pollution and the conservation of deep-sea ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic marine debris is an increasing concern because of its potential negative impacts on marine ecosystems. This is a global problem that will have lasting effects for many reasons, including: (1) the input of debris into marine environments is likely to continue (commensurate with population increase and globalization), (2) accumulation, and possibly retention, of debris will occur in specific areas due to hydrography and geomorphology, and (3) the most common types of debris observed to date will likely persist for centuries. Due to the technical challenges and prohibitive costs of conducting research in the deep sea, little is known about the abundance, types, sources, and impacts of human refuse on this vast habitat, and the extreme depths to which this debris is penetrating has only recently been exposed. We reviewed 1149 video records of marine debris from 22 years of remotely operated vehicle deployments in Monterey Bay, covering depths from 25m to 3971m. We characterize debris by type, examine patterns of distribution, and discuss potential sources and dispersal mechanisms. Debris was most abundant within Monterey Canyon where aggregation and downslope transport of debris from the continental shelf are enhanced by natural canyon dynamics. The majority of debris was plastic (33\%) and metal (23\%). The highest relative frequencies of plastic and metal observations occurred below 2000m, indicating that previous studies may greatly underestimate the extent of anthropogenic marine debris on the seafloor due to limitations in observing deeper regions.

	abstract = {This study reports the first inventory of physical properties of individual plastic debris in the North Atlantic. We analyzed 748 samples for size, mass, and material composition collected from surface net tows on 11 expeditions from Cape Cod, Massachusetts to the Caribbean Sea between 1991 and 2007. Particles were mostly fragments less than 10mm in size with nearly all lighter than 0.05g. Material densities ranged from 0.808 to 1.24gml−1, with about half between 0.97 and 1.04gml−1, a range not typically found in virgin plastics. Elemental analysis suggests that samples in this density range are consistent with polypropylene and polyethylene whose densities have increased, likely due to biofouling. Pelagic densities varied considerably from that of beach plastic debris, suggesting that plastic particles are modified during their residence at sea. These analyses provide clues in understanding particle fate and potential debris sources, and address ecological implications of pelagic plastic debris.},

	abstract = {Plastic debris has been documented in many marine ecosystems, including remote coastlines, the water column, the deep sea, and subtropical gyres. The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG), colloquially called the “Great Pacific Garbage Patch,” has been an area of particular scientific and public concern. However, quantitative assessments of the extent and variability of plastic in the NPSG have been limited. Here, we quantify the distribution, abundance, and size of plastic in a subset of the eastern Pacific (approximately 20–40°N, 120–155°W) over multiple spatial scales. Samples were collected in Summer 2009 using surface and subsurface plankton net tows and quantitative visual observations, and Fall 2010 using surface net tows only. We documented widespread, though spatially variable, plastic pollution in this portion of the NPSG and adjacent waters. The overall median microplastic numerical concentration in Summer 2009 was 0.448 particles m−2 and in Fall 2010 was 0.021 particles m−2, but plastic concentrations were highly variable over the submesoscale (10 s of km). Size-frequency spectra were skewed towards small particles, with the most abundant particles having a cross-sectional area of approximately 0.01 cm2. Most microplastic was found on the sea surface, with the highest densities detected in low-wind conditions. The numerical majority of objects were small particles collected with nets, but the majority of debris surface area was found in large objects assessed visually. Our ability to detect high-plastic areas varied with methodology, as stations with substantial microplastic did not necessarily also contain large visually observable objects. A power analysis of our data suggests that high variability of surface microplastic will make future changes in abundance difficult to detect without substantial sampling effort. Our findings suggest that assessment and monitoring of oceanic plastic debris must account for high spatial variability, particularly in regards to the evaluation of initiatives designed to reduce marine debris.},

From these data we defined an accumulation zone (25 to 41°N, 130 to 180°W) in the North Pacific subtropical gyre that closely corresponds to centers of accumulation resulting from the convergence of ocean surface currents predicted by several oceanographic numerical models. Maximum plastic concentrations from individual surface net tows exceeded 106 pieces km–2, with concentrations decreasing with increasing distance from the predicted center of accumulation. Outside the North Pacific subtropical gyre the median plastic concentration was 0 pieces km–2. We were unable to detect a robust temporal trend in the data set, perhaps because of confounded spatial and temporal variability. Large spatiotemporal variability in plastic concentration causes order of magnitude differences in summary statistics calculated over short time periods or in limited geographic areas. Utilizing all available plankton net data collected in the eastern Pacific Ocean (17.4°S to 61.0°N; 85.0 to 180.0°W) since 1999, we estimated a minimum of 21 290 t of floating microplastic.},

Using data from the Malaspina 2010 circumnavigation, regional surveys, and previously published reports, we show a worldwide distribution of plastic on the surface of the open ocean, mostly accumulating in the convergence zones of each of the five subtropical gyres with comparable density. However, the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface was estimated to be on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. Our observations of the size distribution of floating plastic debris point at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean.},

Starting as a problem of skewed distributions of binary tasks, this topic evolved way beyond this conception. With the expansion of machine learning and data mining, combined with the arrival of big data era, we have gained a deeper insight into the nature of imbalanced learning, while at the same time facing new emerging challenges. Data-level and algorithm-level methods are constantly being improved and hybrid approaches gain increasing popularity. Recent trends focus on analyzing not only the disproportion between classes, but also other difficulties embedded in the nature of data. New real-life problems motivate researchers to focus on computationally efficient, adaptive and real-time methods. This paper aims at discussing open issues and challenges that need to be addressed to further develop the field of imbalanced learning. Seven vital areas of research in this topic are identified, covering the full spectrum of learning from imbalanced data: classification, regression, clustering, data streams, big data analytics and applications, e.g., in social media and computer vision. This paper provides a discussion and suggestions concerning lines of future research for each of them.},

	abstract = {One of the most ubiquitous and long-lasting recent changes to the surface of our planet is the accumulation and fragmentation of plastics. Within just a few decades since mass production of plastic products commenced in the 1950s, plastic debris has accumulated in terrestrial environments, in the open ocean, on shorelines of even the most remote islands and in the deep sea. Annual clean-up operations, costing millions of pounds sterling, are now organized in many countries and on every continent. Here we document global plastics production and the accumulation of plastic waste. While plastics typically constitute approximately 10 per cent of discarded waste, they represent a much greater proportion of the debris accumulating on shorelines.Mega- and macro-plastics have accumulated in the highest densities in the Northern Hemisphere, adjacent to urban centres, in enclosed seas and at water convergences (fronts). We report lower densities on remote island shores, on the continental shelf seabed and the lowest densities (but still a documented presence) in the deep sea and Southern Ocean. The longevity of plastic is estimated to be hundreds to thousands of years, but is likely to be far longer in deep sea and non-surface polar environments. Plastic debris poses considerable threat by choking and starving wildlife, distributing non-native and potentially harmful organisms, absorbing toxic chemicals and degrading to micro-plastics that may subsequently be ingested. Well-established annual surveys on coasts and at sea have shown that trends in mega- and macro-plastic accumulation rates are no longer uniformly increasing: rather stable, increasing and decreasing trends have all been reported. The average size of plastic particles in the environment seems to be decreasing, and the abundance and global distribution of micro-plastic fragments have increased over the last few decades. However, the environmental consequences of such microscopic debris are still poorly understood.},

	abstract = {Estimates of plastic inputs into the ocean are orders of magnitude larger than what is found in the surface waters. This can be due to discrepancies in the sources of plastic released into the ocean but can also be explained by the fact that it is not well-known what the most dominant sinks of marine plastics are and on what time scales these operate. To get a better understanding on possible sources and sinks, an inverse modeling methodology is presented here for a Lagrangian ocean model, estimating floating plastic quantities in the Mediterranean Sea. Field measurements of plastic concentrations in the Mediterranean are used to inform parametrizations defining various sources of marine plastics and removal of plastic particles because of beaching and sinking. The parameters of the model are found using inverse modeling, by comparison of model results and measurements of floating plastic concentrations. Time scales for the sinks are found, and likely sources of plastics can be ranked in importance. A new mass balance is made for floating plastics in the Mediterranean: for 2015, there is an estimated input of 2100–3400 tonnes, and of plastics released since 2006, about 170–420 tonnes remain afloat in the surface waters, 49–63\% ended up on coastlines, and 37–51\% have sunk down.},

	abstract = {Motivation: In life sciences, interpretability of machine learning models is as important as their prediction accuracy. Linear models are probably the most frequently used methods for assessing feature relevance, despite their relative inflexibility. However, in the past years effective estimators of feature relevance have been derived for highly complex or non-parametric models such as support vector machines and RandomForest (RF) models. Recently, it has been observed that RF models are biased in such a way that categorical variables with a large number of categories are preferred.Results: In this work, we introduce a heuristic for normalizing feature importance measures that can correct the feature importance bias. The method is based on repeated permutations of the outcome vector for estimating the distribution of measured importance for each variable in a non-informative setting. The P-value of the observed importance provides a corrected measure of feature importance. We apply our method to simulated data and demonstrate that (i) non-informative predictors do not receive significant P-values, (ii) informative variables can successfully be recovered among non-informative variables and (iii) P-values computed with permutation importance (PIMP) are very helpful for deciding the significance of variables, and therefore improve model interpretability. Furthermore, PIMP was used to correct RF-based importance measures for two real-world case studies. We propose an improved RF model that uses the significant variables with respect to the PIMP measure and show that its prediction accuracy is superior to that of other existing models.Availability: R code for the method presented in this article is available at http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/∼altmann/download/PIMP.RContact:altmann@mpi-inf.mpg.de, laura.tolosi@mpi-inf.mpg.deSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

This study investigates risk factors that significantly contribute to the severity of e-bike collisions. Two months of e-bike collision data were collected in the city of Ningbo, China. A random parameters multinomial logit regression (RP-MNL) is proposed to account for the unobserved heterogeneity across observations. A fixed parameters multinomial logit regression (FP-MNL) is estimated and compared with the RP-MNL under the Bayesian framework. The full Bayesian approach based on Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation is employed to estimate the model parameters. Both parameter estimates and odds ratio (OR) are used to interpret the impact of risk factors on the severity of e-bike collisions. The model comparison results show that RP-MNL outperforms FP-MNL, indicating that accommodating the unobserved heterogeneity across observations could improve the model fit. The model estimation results show that age, gender, e-bike behavior, license plate, bicycle type, location, and speed limit are statistically significant and associated with the severity of e-bike collisions. Furthermore, four risk factors, i.e., gender, e-bike behavior, bicycle type, and speed limit, are found to have heterogeneous effects on severity of e-bike collisions, appearing in the form of random parameters in the statistical model.},

	abstract = {Introduction to Applied Bayesian Statistics and Estimation for Social Scientists covers the complete process of Bayesian statistical analysis in great detail from the development of a model through the process of making statistical inference. The key feature of this book is that it covers models that are most commonly used in social science research, including the linear regression model, generalized linear models, hierarchical models, and multivariate regression models, and it thoroughly develops each real-data example in painstaking detail. The first part of the book provides a detailed introduction to mathematical statistics and the Bayesian approach to statistics, as well as a thorough explanation of the rationale for using simulation methods to construct summaries of posterior distributions. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods—including the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm—are then introduced as general methods for simulating samples from distributions. Extensive discussion of programming MCMC algorithms, monitoring their performance, and improving them is provided before turning to the larger examples involving real social science models and data.Scott M. Lynch is an associate professor in the Department of Sociology and Office of Population Research at Princeton University. His substantive research interests are in changes in racial and socioeconomic inequalities in health and mortality across age and time. His methodological interests are in the use of Bayesian stastistics in sociology and demography generally and in multistate life table methodology specifically.},

	abstract = {In sociological research, it is often difficult to compare nonnested models and to evaluate the fit of models in which outcome variables are not normally distributed. In this article, the authors demonstrate the utility of Bayesian posterior predictive distributions specifically, as well as a Bayesian approach to modeling more generally, in tackling these issues. First, they review the Bayesian approach to statistics and computation. Second, they discuss the evaluation of model fit in a bivariate probit model. Third, they discuss comparing fixed- and random-effects hierarchical linear models. Both examples highlight the use of Bayesian posterior predictive distributions beyond these particular cases.},

	abstract = {Hidden Markov models have become a widely used class of statistical models with applications in diverse areas such as communications engineering, bioinformatics, finance and many more. This book is a comprehensive treatment of inference for hidden Markov models, including both algorithms and statistical theory. Topics range from filtering and smoothing of the hidden Markov chain to parameter estimation, Bayesian methods and estimation of the number of states. In a unified way the book covers both models with finite state spaces, which allow for exact algorithms for filtering, estimation etc. and models with continuous state spaces (also called state-space models) requiring approximate simulation-based algorithms that are also described in detail. Simulation in hidden Markov models is addressed in five different chapters that cover both Markov chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo approaches. Many examples illustrate the algorithms and theory. The book also carefully treats Gaussian linear state-space models and their extensions and it contains a chapter on general Markov chain theory and probabilistic aspects of hidden Markov models. This volume will suit anybody with an interest in inference for stochastic processes, and it will be useful for researchers and practitioners in areas such as statistics, signal processing, communications engineering, control theory, econometrics, finance and more. The algorithmic parts of the book do not require an advanced mathematical background, while the more theoretical parts require knowledge of probability theory at the measure-theoretical level. Olivier Cappé is Researcher for the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS). He received the Ph.D. degree in 1993 from Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications, Paris, France, where he is currently a Research Associate. Most of his current research concerns computational statistics and statistical learning. Eric Moulines is Professor at Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications (ENST), Paris, France. He graduated from Ecole Polytechnique, France, in 1984 and received the Ph.D. degree from ENST in 1990. He has authored more than 150 papers in applied probability, mathematical statistics and signal processing. Tobias Rydén is Professor of Mathematical Statistics at Lund University, Sweden, where he also received his Ph.D. in 1993. His publications include papers ranging from statistical theory to algorithmic developments for hidden Markov models.},

To facilitate the computation of the proposed DD-HSMM methodology, new forward-backward algorithm is developed. The demonstration and evaluation of the proposed methodology is carried out through a case study. The experimental results show that the DD-HSMM methodology is effective for equipment health monitoring and management.},

	abstract = {Idiographic modeling is rapidly gaining popularity, promising to tap into the within-person dynamics underlying psychological phenomena. To gain theoretical understanding of these dynamics, we need to make inferences from time series models about the underlying system. Such inferences are subject to two challenges: first, time series models will arguably always be misspecified, meaning it is unclear how to make inferences to the underlying system; and second, the sampling frequency must be sufficient to capture the dynamics of interest. We discuss both problems with the following approach: we specify a toy model for emotion dynamics as the true system, generate time series data from it, and then try to recover that system with the most popular time series analysis tools. We show that making straightforward inferences from time series models about an underlying system is difficult. We also show that if the sampling frequency is insufficient, the dynamics of interest cannot be recovered. However, we also show that global characteristics of the system can be recovered reliably. We conclude by discussing the consequences of our findings for idiographic modeling and suggest a modeling methodology that goes beyond fitting time series models alone and puts formal theories at the center of theory development.},

	abstract = {While hidden class models of various types arise in many statistical applications, it is often difficult to establish the identifiability of their parameters. Focusing on models in which there is some structure of independence of some of the observed variables conditioned on hidden ones, we demonstrate a general approach for establishing identifiability utilizing algebraic arguments. A theorem of J. Kruskal for a simple latent-class model with finite state space lies at the core of our results, though we apply it to a diverse set of models. These include mixtures of both finite and nonparametric product distributions, hidden Markov models and random graph mixture models, and lead to a number of new results and improvements to old ones. In the parametric setting, this approach indicates that for such models, the classical definition of identifiability is typically too strong. Instead generic identifiability holds, which implies that the set of nonidentifiable parameters has measure zero, so that parameter inference is still meaningful. In particular, this sheds light on the properties of finite mixtures of Bernoulli products, which have been used for decades despite being known to have nonidentifiable parameters. In the nonparametric setting, we again obtain identifiability only when certain restrictions are placed on the distributions that are mixed, but we explicitly describe the conditions.},

	abstract = {Hidden Markov models are prevalent in animal movement modelling, where they are widely used to infer behavioural modes and their drivers from various types of telemetry data. To allow for meaningful inference, observations need to be equally spaced in time, or otherwise regularly sampled, where the corresponding temporal resolution strongly affects what kind of behaviours can be inferred from the data. Recent advances in biologging technology have led to a variety of novel telemetry sensors which often collect data from the same individual simultaneously at different time-scales, for example step lengths obtained from GPS tags every hour, dive depths obtained from time-depth recorders once per dive, or accelerations obtained from accelerometers several times per second. However, to date, statistical machinery to address the corresponding complex multi-stream and multi-scale data is lacking. We propose hierarchical hidden Markov models as a versatile statistical framework that naturally accounts for differing temporal resolutions across multiple variables. In these models, the observations are regarded as stemming from multiple connected behavioural processes, each of which operates at the time-scale at which the corresponding variables were observed. By jointly modelling multiple data streams, collected at different temporal resolutions, corresponding models can be used to infer behavioural modes at multiple time-scales and in particular, help to draw a much more comprehensive picture of an animal's movement patterns, for example with regard to long-term versus short-term movement strategies. The suggested approach is illustrated in two real-data applications, where we jointly model (a) coarse-scale horizontal and fine-scale vertical Atlantic cod Gadus morhua movements throughout the English Channel, and (b) coarse-scale horizontal movements and corresponding fine-scale accelerations of a horn shark Heterodontus francisci tagged off the Californian coast.},

We consider services provided by nursing homes with the aim of ranking a set of these structures with respect to their effect on resident health status. Since the overall health status is not directly observable, and given the longitudinal and multilevel structure of the available data, we rely on latent variable models and, in particular, on a multilevel latent Markov model where residents and nursing homes are the first and the second level units, respectively. The model includes individual covariates to account for resident characteristics. The impact of nursing home membership is modelled through a pair of random effects affecting the initial distribution and the transition probabilities between different levels of health status. Through the prediction of these random effects we obtain a ranking of the nursing homes. Furthermore, the proposed model accounts for nonignorable dropout due to resident death, which typically occurs in these contexts. The motivating dataset is gathered from the Long Term Care Facilities programme, a health care protocol implemented in Umbria (Italy). Our results show that differences in performance between nursing homes are statistically significant.},

	abstract = {Drop out is a typical issue in longitudinal studies. When the missingness is non-ignorable, inference based on the observed data only may be biased. This paper is motivated by the Leiden 85+ study, a longitudinal study conducted to analyze the dynamics of cognitive functioning in the elderly. We account for dependence between longitudinal responses from the same subject using time-varying random effects associated with a heterogeneous hidden Markov chain. As several participants in the study drop out prematurely, we introduce a further random effect model to describe the missing data mechanism.

As with any complex model, it is not always obvious whether all the parameters are identifiable, or if the model is parameter redundant; that is, the model can be reparameterised in terms of a smaller number of parameters. This paper considers different methods for detecting parameter redundancy and identifiability in hidden Markov models. We examine both numerical methods and methods that involve symbolic algebra. These symbolic methods require a unique representation of a model, known as an exhaustive summary. We provide an exhaustive summary for hidden Markov models and show how it can be used to investigate identifiability.},

	abstract = {Hidden Markov and semi-Markov models (H(S)MMs) constitute useful tools for modeling observations subject to certain dependency structures. The hidden states render these models very flexible and allow them to capture many different types of latent patterns and dynamics present in the data. This has led to the increased popularity of these models, which have been applied to a variety of problems in various domains and settings, including longitudinal data. In many longitudinal studies, the response variable is categorical or count-type. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) can be used to analyze a wide range of variables, including categorical and count. The present study proposes a model that combines HSMMs with GLMMs, leading to generalized linear mixed hidden semi-Markov models (GLM-HSMMs). These models can account for time-varying unobserved heterogeneity and handle different response types. Parameter estimation is achieved using a Monte Carlo Newton-Raphson (MCNR)-like algorithm. In our proposed model, the distribution of the random effects depends on hidden states. We illustrate the applicability of GLM-HSMMs with an example in the field of occupational health, where the response variable consists of count values. Furthermore, we assess the performance of our MCNR-like algorithm through a simulation study.},

	abstract = {Students who wish to learn a specific skill have increasing access to a growing number of online courses and open-source educational repositories of instructional tools, including videos, slides, and exercises. Navigating these tools is time-consuming and the search itself can hinder the learning of the skill. Educators are hence interested in aiding students by selecting the optimal content sequence for individual learners, specifically which skill one should learn next and which material one should use to study. Such adaptive selection would rely on pre-knowledge of how the learners’ and the instructional tools’ characteristics jointly affect the probability of acquiring a certain skill. Building upon previous research on Latent Transition Analysis and Learning Trajectories, we propose a multilevel logistic hidden Markov model for learning based on cognitive diagnosis models, where the probability that a learner acquires the target skill depends not only on the general difficulty of the skill and the learner’s mastery of other skills in the curriculum but also on the effectiveness of the particular learning tool and its interaction with mastery of other skills, captured by random slopes and intercepts for each learning tool. A Bayesian modeling framework and an MCMC algorithm for parameter estimation are proposed and evaluated using a simulation study.},

The ability to account for varying levels of behavioral scale has become possible through hierarchical hidden Markov models, but additional levels lead to higher complexity and increased correlation between model components. Maximum likelihood approaches to inference using the EM algorithm and direct optimization of likelihoods are more frequently used, with Bayesian approaches being less favored due to computational demands. Given these demands, it is vital that efficient estimation algorithms are developed when Bayesian methods are preferred. We study the use of various approaches to improve convergence times and mixing in Markov chain Monte Carlo methods applied to hierarchical hidden Markov models, including parallel tempering as an inference facilitation mechanism. The method shows promise for analysing complex stochastic models with high levels of correlation between components, but our results show that it requires careful tuning in order to maximize that potential.},

The model includes individual covariates to account for resident characteristics. The impact of nursing home membership is modelled through a pair of random effects affecting the initial distribution and the transition probabilities between different levels of health status. Through the prediction of these random effects we obtain a ranking of the nursing homes. Furthermore, the proposed model accounts for nonignorable dropout due to resident death, which typically occurs in these contexts.

The data at hand are affected by multiple sources of latent heterogeneity, due to multilevel unobserved factors that operate in conjunction with observed covariates at all the levels of the data hierarchy. We fit a multilevel logistic regression model for repeated measurements of player behaviors, nested within groups of interacting players. The model integrates discrete random effects at the group level and Markovian sequences of discrete random effects at the player level. Parameters are estimated by a computationally feasible expectation-maximization algorithm. We model the probability of playing the Hawk strategy, which implies fighting aggressively for controlling an asset, and test the role played by initial possession, property, and other player-specific characteristics in driving hawkish behaviors. The results from our study suggest that crucial factors in determining hawkish behavior are both the way possession is achieved – which depends on our treatment manipulation- and possession itself. Furthermore, a clear time-dependence is observed in the data at the player level as accounted for by the Markovian random effects.},

Owing to the inherent difficulty of empirical field studies, ecological state dynamics operating at any level of this hierarchy can often be unobservable or ‘hidden’. Ecologists must therefore often contend with incomplete or indirect observations that are somehow related to these underlying processes. By formally disentangling state and observation processes based on simple yet powerful mathematical properties that can be used to describe many ecological phenomena, hidden Markov models (HMMs) can facilitate inferences about complex system state dynamics that might otherwise be intractable. However, HMMs have only recently begun to gain traction within the broader ecological community. We provide a gentle introduction to HMMs, establish some common terminology, review the immense scope of HMMs for applied ecological research and provide a tutorial on implementation and interpretation. By illustrating how practitioners can use a simple conceptual template to customise HMMs for their specific systems of interest, revealing methodological links between existing applications, and highlighting some practical considerations and limitations of these approaches, our goal is to help establish HMMs as a fundamental inferential tool for ecologists.},

	abstract = {The study of animal behavioral states inferred through hidden Markov models and similar state switching models has seen a significant increase in popularity in recent years. The ability to account for varying levels of behavioral scale has become possible through hierarchical hidden Markov models, but additional levels lead to higher complexity and increased correlation between model components. Maximum likelihood approaches to inference using the EM algorithm and direct optimization of likelihoods are more frequently used, with Bayesian approaches being less favored due to computational demands. Given these demands, it is vital that efficient estimation algorithms are developed when Bayesian methods are preferred. We study the use of various approaches to improve convergence times and mixing in Markov chain Monte Carlo methods applied to hierarchical hidden Markov models, including parallel tempering as an inference facilitation mechanism. The method shows promise for analysing complex stochastic models with high levels of correlation between components, but our results show that it requires careful tuning in order to maximize that potential.},

	abstract = {Laboratory-based experimental methods historically have been the strength and pride of psychology and related disciplines. Yet a comprehensive science of behavior also requires the study of humans in real life. Bringing together leading investigators, this book reviews the breadth of current approaches for studying how people think, feel, and behave in everyday environments. The Handbook is organized in four parts. Part I covers the theoretical and methodological foundations of conducting daily life research. Part II provides guidance for designing a high-quality study and selecting and implementing appropriate methods. The chapters describe experience sampling methods, diary methods, ambulatory physiological measures, and other tools—including recording technologies and computerized approaches—that allow repeated, real-time measurement in natural settings. Part III focuses on techniques for analyzing intensive data from daily life, featuring practical discussions of power analysis, psychometrics, data cleaning, multilevel modeling, time series analysis, and other topics. Part IV reviews how methods for studying daily life have been employed in different subfields and research areas, such as the study of emotion, close relationships, personality, health, development, psychopathology, and mental health treatment. Specific advantages and challenges inherent to using the methods in each area are discussed. Timely and authoritative, this handbook meets a key need for research psychologists and for graduate students in social/personality, health, developmental, industrial/organizational, and clinical psychology.

In the context of mood disorders and mood dysregulation, we demonstrate that EMA can address specific research questions better than laboratory or questionnaire studies. However, before clinicians and researchers can fully realize these benefits, sets of standardized e-diary questionnaires and time sampling protocols must be developed that are reliable, valid, and sensitive to change.

This approach began with straightforward paper and pencil diaries that participants completed on fixed schedules (Hurlburt, 1979; Larson \& Csikszentmihalyi, 1978; Sorokin \& Berger, 1939; Wessman \& Ricks, 1966). Over time, protocols have become more extensive, often including preprinted diaries with survey questions covering a diversity of experiential and contextual topics. The primary objective of these data collection strategies is to achieve greater ecological validity in the measurement of psychological states than can be realized through either infrequent administration of self-report surveys or via research conducted in decontextualized (e.g., laboratory) settings. The protocols also elicit information on underlying psychological processes that can only be revealed through the analysis of intensive longitudinal measurements. The central goal of this chapter, however, is to provide a thoughtful exposition of important considerations in conducting a multilevel model of intensive longitudinal data. A concomitant goal is to provide an applied demonstration of the model. We pursue these goals in three complementary sections. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Basic models and examples are discussed in non-technical terms with an emphasis on understanding the methodological and statistical issues involved in using these models. The estimation and interpretation of multilevel models is demonstrated using realistic examples from various disciplines. For example, readers will find data sets on stress in hospitals, GPA scores, survey responses, street safety, epilepsy, divorce, and sociometric scores, to name a few. The data sets are available on the website in SPSS, HLM, MLwiN, LISREL and/or Mplus files. Readers are introduced to both the multilevel regression model and multilevel structural models. Highlights of the second edition include: Two new chapters—one on multilevel models for ordinal and count data (Ch. 7) and another on multilevel survival analysis (Ch. 8); Thoroughly updated chapters on multilevel structural equation modeling that reflect the enormous technical progress of the last few years; The addition of some simpler examples to help the novice, whilst the more complex examples that combine more than one problem have been retained; A new section on multivariate meta-analysis (Ch. 11); Expanded discussions of covariance structures across time and analyzing longitudinal data where no trend is expected; Expanded chapter on the logistic model for dichotomous data and proportions with new estimation methods; and An updated website at www.¡oophox.net/ with data sets for all the text examples and up-to-date screen shots and PowerPoint slides for instructors. Ideal for introductory courses on multilevel modeling and/or ones that introduce this topic in some detail taught in a variety of disciplines including: psychology, education, sociology, the health sciences, and business the advanced extensions also make this a favorite resource for researchers and methodologists in these disciplines.

We show how the MLE problem yields to an EM generalization known as an ECM algorithm. For certain types of variance constraints, yet another generalization of EM, known as MM algorithms, is required. After a brief explanation of these algorithmic ideas, we demonstrate how they may be applied to parameter estimation and hypothesis testing in finite mixtures of normal components in the presence of linear constraints on both mean and variance parameters.

We show that exploration of these modes can be imposed using tempered transitions.

While MCMC provides a convenient way to draw inference from complicated statistical models, there are many, perhaps underappreciated, problems associated with the MCMC analysis of mixtures. The problems are mainly caused by the nonidentifiability of the components under symmetric priors, which leads to so-called label switching in the MCMC output. This means that ergodic averages of component specific quantities will be identical and thus useless for inference. We review the solutions to the label switching problem, such as artificial identifiability constraints, relabelling algorithms and label invariant loss functions.

	isbn = {978-1-84169-722-2 978-0-203-84885-2},
	abstract = {Model selection consists of comparing two or more models—which represent different theories about reality—and deciding which of these models gives the best description of the current data. The dominant approach to model selection in the social and behavioral sciences is null hypothesis testing (NHT). This approach has received much criticism over the years, ranging from practical issues to more philosophical ones. Some of the most eminent practical limitations of using NHT for model selection purposes are: its limitation to the comparison of two models; the need for these two models to be nested; and the impossibility of finding evidence for the null model. An alternative approach to model selection, which does not suffer from these limitations, was started by Akaike, who developed An Information Criterion (AIC, typically referred to as Akaike's Information Criterion). Not long after the introduction of the AIC, the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was introduced by Schwarz, which is also referred to as the Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC). Although the BIC bears a strong resemblance to the AIC, the two measures have quite different roots: While the AIC is derived within the framework of information theory, the BIC is based on the posterior model probability, which is an inherently Bayesian concept. More recently the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) was introduced by Spiegelhalter, Best, Carlin, and Van der Linde, which is derived within a decision theoretical framework. All three information criteria can be recognized as a penalized log likelihood, which balances model fit in the form of the log likelihood and model complexity in the form of the dimension of the model. Despite the advantages of information criteria for model selection and their inclusion in most multilevel modeling (MLM) programs, the literature on model selection in MLM is dominated by NHT. The aim of this chapter is to provide detailed derivations of the AIC, DIC, and BIC, and to discuss and illustrate their application in the context of MLM. In the following section the basics of model selection using information criteria are presented. This is followed by a section on MLM in which the Laird-Ware model is presented, which is a general way to present multilevel models with two levels. In addition, two inferential focuses in MLM are discussed, which are based on whether or not the random effects are integrated out of the model. In the third section we derive the three information criteria and discuss their application in MLM. In the fourth section we present an empirical illustration, in which we make use of five different software packages and compare multiple nested and nonnested models. We end this chapter with a discussion in which we summarize the most important findings of this chapter and discuss several additional issues that are relevant when using information criteria.

	abstract = {Summary. We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the ‘hat’ matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

	abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of probability, Jeffresy developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpies was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: From Jeffrey's Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. In "non-Bayesian significance tests. The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.},

The ion channel molecule may reside in several configurations, some of which correspond to an open channel and others to a closed channel. The transitions of the channel between the different configurational states have a random nature. Markov processes are often used to describe this randomness. In practice, there often exist a number of candidate Markov models. The objective of this paper is the selection of a Markov model from a finite collection of such models. We propose a Bayesian setting in which the model indicator itself is viewed as a random variable, and we develop a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm in order to generate a sample from the posterior distribution of the model indicator given the data of a single-channel recording. A hidden Markov model is used to incorporate the correlated noise in recordings and the effects of filters that are present in the experimental set-up. The reversible jump MCMC sampler is applied to both simulated and recorded data sets.},

Early advancements in HMMs have mainly assumed that the number of hidden states is fixed and predetermined based on the knowledge of the subjects or a certain criterion. However, as a limitation, this approach determines the number of hidden states on a pairwise basis, which becomes increasingly tedious when the state space is enlarged. Moreover, criterion-based statistics tend to select complex models with overestimated numbers of components in mixture modeling. A full Bayesian approach is developed to analyze hidden Markov structural equation models with an unknown number of hidden states. An efficient and hybrid algorithm that combines the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm, the forward filtering and backward sampling scheme, and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is proposed to simultaneously select the number of hidden states and perform parameter estimation. The simulation study shows the satisfactory performance of the proposed method. Two real datasets collected from the UCLA Drug Abuse Research Center and National Longitudinal Survey of Youth are analyzed.},

We describe a number of extensions of HMMs for animal movement modeling, including more flexible state transition models and individual random effects (fitted in a non-Bayesian framework). In particular we consider so-called hidden semi-Markov models, which may substantially improve the goodness of fit and provide important insights into the behavioral state switching dynamics.

The state-dependent distributions in HMMs are usually taken from some class of parametrically specified distributions. The choice of this class can be difficult, and an unfortunate choice can have serious consequences for example on state estimates, and more generally on the resulting model complexity and interpretation. We demonstrate these practical issues in a real data application concerned with vertical speeds of a diving beaked whale, where we demonstrate that parametric approaches can easily lead to overly complex state processes, impeding meaningful biological inference. In contrast, for the dive data, HMMs with nonparametrically estimated state-dependent distributions are much more parsimonious in terms of the number of states and easier to interpret, while fitting the data equally well. Our nonparametric estimation approach is based on the idea of representing the densities of the state-dependent distributions as linear combinations of a large number of standardized B-spline basis functions, imposing a penalty term on non-smoothness in order to maintain a good balance between goodness-of-fit and smoothness.},

Generally all priors work well with the exception of the inverse Wishart when the true variance is small relative to prior mean. In this case, the posterior for the variance is biased toward larger values and the correlation is biased toward zero. This bias persists even for large sample sizes and therefore caution should be used when using the inverse Wishart prior.},

	abstract = {We have developed a statistical method for the analysis of array based CGH data to detect genomic DNA copy number changes. Our method allows us to answer the biologically relevant questions (what is the probability that a given gene or region has increased or decreased copy number changes) in a clear and simple way, within a rigorous statistical framework. We use a non-homogeneous Hidden Markov Model that incorporates distance between genes, a crucial requirement to analyze data from platforms where distances between probes is highly variable. As the true number of hidden states (states of copy number changes) is not known in advance in biological samples, we do not ﬁx the number of hidden states of the model, but use Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo for inference. We can therefore investigate the likely number of hidden states in the data and, more importantly, provide posterior probabilities that a gene or a set of genes is in a given state. To summarize results, we employ Bayesian Model Averaging, averaging over models with different states, and thus incorporating model uncertainty. Our method can be used to analyze data from each chromosome independently or all chromosomes together, offering both ﬂexibility in the biological phenomena studied and increased statistical precision. Thus, our method provides a rigorous statistical foundation for locating genes and chromosomal regions with altered copy number and potentially related to cancer and other complex diseases.},

However, the performance of mixed HMMs has not yet been sufficiently explored to justify their widespread adoption, and there is currently little guidance for practitioners weighing the costs and benefits of mixed HMMs for a particular research objective. I performed an extensive simulation study comparing the performance of a suite of fixed and random effect models for individual heterogeneity in the hidden state process of a two-state HMM. I focused on sampling scenarios more typical of telemetry studies, which often consist of relatively long time series (30–250 observations per animal) for relatively few individuals (5–100 animals). I generally found mixed HMMs did not improve state assignment relative to standard HMMs. Reliable estimation of random effects required larger sample sizes than are often feasible in telemetry studies. Continuous random effect models performed reasonably well with data generated under discrete random effects, but not vice versa. Random effects accounting for unexplained individual variation can improve estimation of state transition probabilities and measurable covariate effects, but discrete random effects can be a relatively poor (and potentially misleading) approximation for continuous variation. When weighing the costs and benefits of mixed HMMs, three important considerations are study objectives, sample size and model complexity. HMM applications often focus on state assignment with little emphasis on heterogeneity in state transition probabilities, in which case random effects in the hidden state process simply may not be worth the additional effort. However, if explaining variation in state transition probabilities is a primary objective and sufficient explanatory covariates are not available, then random effects are worth pursuing as a more parsimonious alternative to individual fixed effects. To help put my findings in context and illustrate some potential challenges that practitioners may encounter when applying mixed HMMs, I revisit a previous analysis of long-finned pilot whale biotelemetry data.},

	abstract = {Recent technological advances have permitted the collection of detailed animal location and ancillary biotelemetry data that facilitate inference about animal movement and associated behaviors. However, these rich sources of individual information, location, and biotelemetry data, are typically analyzed independently, with population-level inferences remaining largely post hoc. We describe a hierarchical modeling approach, which is able to integrate location and ancillary biotelemetry (e.g., physiological or accelerometer) data from many individuals. We can thus obtain robust estimates of (1) population-level movement parameters and (2) activity budgets for a set of behaviors among which animals transition as they respond to changes in their internal and external environment. Measurement error and missing data are easily accommodated using a state-space formulation of the proposed hierarchical model. Using Bayesian analysis methods, we demonstrate our modeling approach with location and dive activity data from 17 harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) in the United Kingdom. Based jointly on movement and diving activity, we identified three distinct movement behavior states: resting, foraging, and transit, and estimated population-level activity budgets to these three states. Because harbor seals are known to dive for both foraging and transit (but not usually for resting), we compared these results to a similar population-level analysis utilizing only location data. We found that a large proportion of time steps were mischaracterized when behavior states were inferred from horizontal trajectory alone, with 33\% of time steps exhibiting a majority of dive activity assigned to the resting state. Only 1\% of these time steps were assigned to resting when inferred from both trajectory and dive activity data using our integrated modeling approach. There is mounting evidence of the potential perils of inferring animal behavior based on trajectory alone, but there fortunately now exist many flexible analytical techniques for extracting more out of the increasing wealth of information afforded by recent advances in biologging technology.},

	abstract = {This paper is about how we study statistical methods. As an example, it uses the random regressions model, in which the intercept and slope of cluster-specific regression lines are modeled as a bivariate random effect. Maximizing this model's restricted likelihood often gives a boundary value for the random effect correlation or variances. We argue that this is a problem; that it is a problem because our discipline has little understanding of how contemporary models and methods map data to inferential summaries; that we lack such understanding, even for models as simple as this, because of a near-exclusive reliance on mathematics as a means of understanding; and that math alone is no longer sufficient. We then argue that as a discipline, we can and should break open our black-box methods by mimicking the five steps that molecular biologists commonly use to break open Nature's black boxes: design a simple model system, formulate hypotheses using that system, test them in experiments on that system, iterate as needed to reformulate and test hypotheses, and finally test the results in an "in vivo" system. We demonstrate this by identifying conditions under which the random-regressions restricted likelihood is likely to be maximized at a boundary value. Resistance to this approach seems to arise from a view that it lacks the certainty or intellectual heft of mathematics, perhaps because simulation experiments in our literature rarely do more than measure a new method's operating characteristics in a small range of situations. We argue that such work can make useful contributions including, as in molecular biology, the findings themselves and sometimes the designs used in the five steps; that these contributions have as much practical value as mathematical results; and that therefore they merit publication as much as the mathematical results our discipline esteems so highly.},

Species with long reproductive cycles and high parental investment, such as marine mammals, rely on such behavioral plasticity to cope with rapid environmental change, including anthropogenic stressors. We quantified activity budgets of free-ranging long-finned pilot whales in order to assess individual time trade-offs between foraging and other behaviors in different individual and ecological contexts, and during experimental sound exposures. The experiments included 1–2 and 6–7 kHz naval sonar exposures (a potential anthropogenic stressor), playback of killer whale (a potential predator/competitor) vocalizations, and negative controls. We combined multiple time series data from digital acoustic recording tags (DTAG) as well as group-level social behavior data from visual observations of tagged whales at the surface. The data were classified into near-surface behaviors and dive types (using a hidden Markov model for dive transitions) and aggregated into time budgets. On average, individuals (N = 19) spent most of their time (69\%) resting and transiting near surface, 21\% in shallow dives (depth {\textless}40 m), and only 10\% of their time in deep foraging dives, of which 65\% reached a depth 10 m from the sea bottom. Individuals in the largest of three body size classes or accompanied by calves tended to spend more time foraging than others. Simultaneous tagging of pairs of individuals showed that up to 50\% of the activity budget was synchronized between conspecifics with decreased synchrony during foraging periods. Individuals spent less time foraging when forming larger non-vocal aggregations of individuals in late afternoons, and more time foraging when in the mid-range of water depths (300–400 m) available in the study area (50–700 m). Individuals reduced foraging time by 83\% (29–96\%) during their first exposure to sonar, but not during killer whale sound playbacks. A relative increase in foraging during repeat sonar exposures indicated habituation or change in response tactic. We discuss the possible adaptive value of these trade-offs in time allocation to reduce individual conflict while maintaining benefits of group living.},

The user defines the joint likelihood for the data and the random effects as a C++ template function, while all the other operations are done in R; e.g., reading in the data. The package evaluates and maximizes the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood where the random effects are automatically integrated out. This approximation, and its derivatives, are obtained using automatic differentiation (up to order three) of the joint likelihood. The computations are designed to be fast for problems with many random effects (≈ 106 ) and parameters (≈ 103 ). Computation times using ADMB and TMB are compared on a suite of examples ranging from simple models to large spatial models where the random effects are a Gaussian random field. Speedups ranging from 1.5 to about 100 are obtained with increasing gains for large problems. The package and examples are available at http://tmb-project.org/.},

	abstract = {Bayesian state-space movement models have been proposed as a method of inferring behavioural states from movement paths (Morales et al. 2004), thereby providing insight into the behavioural processes from which patterns of animal space use arise in heterogeneous environments. It is not clear, however, how effective state-space models are at estimating behavioural states. We use stochastic simulations of two movement models to quantify how behavioural state movement characteristics affect classification error. State-space movement models can be a highly effective approach to estimating behavioural states from movement paths. Classification accuracy was contingent upon the degree of separation between the distributions that characterize the states (e.g. step length and turn angle distributions) and the relative frequency of the behavioural states. In the best case scenarios classification accuracy approached 100\%, but was close to 0\% when step length and turn angle distributions of each state were similar, or when one state was rare. Mean classification accuracy was uncorrelated with path length, but the variance in classification accuracy was inversely related to path length. Importantly, we find that classification accuracy can be predicted based on the separation between distributions that characterize the movement paths, thereby providing a method of estimating classification accuracy for real movement paths. We demonstrate this approach using radiotelemetry relocation data of 34 moose (Alces alces). We conclude that Bayesian state-space models offer powerful new opportunities for inferring behavioural states from relocation data.},

I use simulated movement paths with known behavioural states to compare estimation error between nonhierarchical and joint estimation formulations of an otherwise identical state-space model. Behavioural state estimation error was strongly affected by the degree of similarity between movement patterns characterising the behavioural states, with less error when movements were strongly dissimilar between states. The joint estimation model improved behavioural state estimation relative to the nonhierarchical model for simulated data with heavy-tailed Argos location errors. When applied to Argos telemetry datasets from 10 Weddell seals, the nonhierarchical model estimated highly uncertain behavioural state switching probabilities for most individuals whereas the joint estimation model yielded substantially less uncertainty. The joint estimation model better resolved the behavioural state sequences across all seals. Hierarchical or joint estimation models should be the preferred choice for estimating behavioural states from animal movement data, especially when location data are error-prone.},

This is primarily because of the emergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. While MCMC provides a convenient way to draw inference from complicated statistical models, there are many, perhaps underappreciated, problems associated with the MCMC analysis of mixtures. The problems are mainly caused by the nonidentifiability of the components under symmetric priors, which leads to so-called label switching in the MCMC output. This means that ergodic averages of component specific quantities will be identical and thus useless for inference. We review the solutions to the label switching problem, such as artificial identifiability constraints, relabelling algorithms and label invariant loss functions. We also review various MCMC sampling schemes that have been suggested for mixture models and discuss posterior sensitivity to prior specification.},

	abstract = {The activity of sensory cortical neurons is not only driven by external stimuli but also shaped by other sources of input to the cortex. Unlike external stimuli, these other sources of input are challenging to experimentally control, or even observe, and as a result contribute to variability of neural responses to sensory stimuli. However, such sources of input are likely not “noise” and may play an integral role in sensory cortex function. Here we introduce the rectified latent variable model (RLVM) in order to identify these sources of input using simultaneously recorded cortical neuron populations. The RLVM is novel in that it employs nonnegative (rectified) latent variables and is much less restrictive in the mathematical constraints on solutions because of the use of an autoencoder neural network to initialize model parameters. We show that the RLVM outperforms principal component analysis, factor analysis, and independent component analysis, using simulated data across a range of conditions. We then apply this model to two-photon imaging of hundreds of simultaneously recorded neurons in mouse primary somatosensory cortex during a tactile discrimination task. Across many experiments, the RLVM identifies latent variables related to both the tactile stimulation as well as nonstimulus aspects of the behavioral task, with a majority of activity explained by the latter. These results suggest that properly identifying such latent variables is necessary for a full understanding of sensory cortical function and demonstrate novel methods for leveraging large population recordings to this end.
            NEW \& NOTEWORTHY The rapid development of neural recording technologies presents new opportunities for understanding patterns of activity across neural populations. Here we show how a latent variable model with appropriate nonlinear form can be used to identify sources of input to a neural population and infer their time courses. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these sources are related to behavioral contexts outside of direct experimental control.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of extracting smooth, low-dimensional neural trajectories that summarize the activity recorded simultaneously from many neurons on individual experimental trials. Beyond the benefit of visualizing the high-dimensional, noisy spiking activity in a compact form, such trajectories can offer insight into the dynamics of the neural circuitry underlying the recorded activity. Current methods for extracting neural trajectories involve a two-stage process: the spike trains are first smoothed over time, then a static dimensionality-reduction technique is applied. We first describe extensions of the two-stage methods that allow the degree of smoothing to be chosen in a principled way and that account for spiking variability, which may vary both across neurons and across time. We then present a novel method for extracting neural trajectories—Gaussian-process factor analysis (GPFA)—which unifies the smoothing and dimensionality-reduction operations in a common probabilistic framework. We applied these methods to the activity of 61 neurons recorded simultaneously in macaque premotor and motor cortices during reach planning and execution. By adopting a goodness-of-fit metric that measures how well the activity of each neuron can be predicted by all other recorded neurons, we found that the proposed extensions improved the predictive ability of the two-stage methods. The predictive ability was further improved by going to GPFA. From the extracted trajectories, we directly observed a convergence in neural state during motor planning, an effect that was shown indirectly by previous studies. We then show how such methods can be a powerful tool for relating the spiking activity across a neural population to the subject's behavior on a single-trial basis. Finally, to assess how well the proposed methods characterize neural population activity when the underlying time course is known, we performed simulations that revealed that GPFA performed tens of percent better than the best two-stage method.},

In our previous work (Chen Z, Zhang Q, Tong AP, Manders TR, Wang J. J Neural Eng 14: 036023, 2017), we developed a latent state-space model, known as the Poisson linear dynamical system, for detecting abrupt changes in neuronal ensemble spike activity. In online brain-machine interface (BMI) applications, a recursive filtering algorithm is used to track the changes in the latent variable. However, previous methods have been restricted to Gaussian dynamical noise and have used Gaussian approximation for the Poisson likelihood. To improve the detection speed, we introduce non-Gaussian dynamical noise for modeling a stochastic jump process in the latent state space. To efficiently estimate the state posterior that accommodates non-Gaussian noise and non-Gaussian likelihood, we propose particle filtering and smoothing algorithms for the change-point detection problem. To speed up the computation, we implement the proposed particle filtering algorithms using advanced graphics processing unit computing technology. We validate our algorithms, using both computer simulations and experimental data for acute pain detection. Finally, we discuss several important practical issues in the context of real-time closed-loop BMI applications.

	abstract = {Background
The classification of motor imagery electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) is a pivotal task in the biosignal classification process in the brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. Currently, this bio-engineering-based technology is being employed by researchers in various fields to develop cutting-edge applications. The classification of real-time MI-EEG signals is the most challenging task in these applications. The prediction performance of the existing classification methods is still limited due to the high dimensionality and dynamic behaviors of the real-time EEG data.
Proposed method
To enhance the classification performance of real-time BCI applications, this paper presents a new clustering-based ensemble technique called CluSem to mitigate this problem. We also develop a new brain game called CluGame using this method to evaluate the classification performance of real-time motor imagery movements. In this game, real-time EEG signal classification and prediction tabulation through animated balls are controlled via threads. By playing this game, users can control the movements of the balls via the brain signals of motor imagery movements without using any traditional input devices.
Results
Our results demonstrate that CluSem is able to improve the classification accuracy between 5\% and 15\% compared to the existing methods on our collected as well as the publicly available EEG datasets.

	abstract = {Objective
Sleep stage scoring is essential for diagnosing sleep disorders. Visual scoring of sleep stages is very time-consuming and prone to human errors. In this work, we introduce an efficient approach to improve the accuracy of sleep stage scoring and classification for sleep analysis.
Method
In this approach, a set of optimal features was first selected from a pool of features extracted from sleep EEG epochs by using a feature selection method based on the relevance and redundancy analysis. EEG segments were then classified using a random forest classifier. Finally, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was used to reduce false positives by incorporating knowledge of the temporal structure of transitions between sleep stages. We evaluated the proposed method using single-channel EEG signals from four public sleep EEG datasets scored according to R\&K and AASM guidelines. We compared the performance of our method with existing methods using different cross validation strategies.
Results
Using a leave-one-out validation strategy, our method achieved overall accuracies in the range of (79.4–87.4\%) and (77.6–80.4\%) with Kappa values in the range of 0.7–0.85 for six-stage (R\&K) and five-stage (AASM) classification, respectively. Our method showed a reduction in overall accuracy up to 8\% using the cross-dataset validation strategy in comparison with the subject cross-validation method.
Comparison with existing method(s)
Our method outperformed the existing methods for all multi-stage classification.
Conclusions
The proposed single-channel method can be used for robust and reliable sleep stage scoring with high accuracy and relatively low complexity required for real time applications.},

Rodent hippocampal population codes represent important spatial information about the environment during navigation. Computational methods have been developed to uncover the neural representation of spatial topology embedded in rodent hippocampal ensemble spike activity.
New method
We extend our previous work and propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric approach to infer rat hippocampal population codes during spatial navigation. To tackle the model selection problem, we leverage a Bayesian nonparametric model. Specifically, we apply a hierarchical Dirichlet process-hidden Markov model (HDP-HMM) using two Bayesian inference methods, one based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and the other based on variational Bayes (VB).
Results
The effectiveness of our Bayesian approaches is demonstrated on recordings from a freely behaving rat navigating in an open field environment.
Comparison with existing methods
The HDP-HMM outperforms the finite-state HMM in both simulated and experimental data. For HPD-HMM, the MCMC-based inference with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) hyperparameter sampling is flexible and efficient, and outperforms VB and MCMC approaches with hyperparameters set by empirical Bayes.
Conclusion
The Bayesian nonparametric HDP-HMM method can efficiently perform model selection and identify model parameters, which can used for modeling latent-state neuronal population dynamics.},

Much effort has been devoted to the clustering step, despite the fact that conservative spike detection is notoriously difficult in low signal-to-noise conditions and often entails many spike misses. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) can serve as generative models for continuous extracellular data records. These models naturally combine the spike detection and classification steps into a single computational procedure. They unify the advantages of independent component analysis (ICA) and overlap-search algorithms because they blindly perform source separation even in cases where several neurons are recorded on a single electrode. We apply HMMs to artificially generated data and to extracellular signals recorded with glass electrodes. We show that in comparison with state-of-art spike-sorting algorithms, HMM-based spike sorting exhibits a comparable number of false positive spike classifications but many fewer spike misses.},

In the latter cases the visual stimuli are recognized at rates of more than 90\% from the neuronal spike patterns.

This work presents a novel method of characterizing this supposed activity using a hidden Markov model.

In our study the process in hand was the simultaneous activity of several cells recorded from the frontal cortex of behaving monkeys. Using such a model we were able to identify the behavioural mode of the animal and directly identify the corresponding collective network activity. Furthermore, the segmentation of the data into the discrete states also provides direct evidence for the state dependence of the short-time correlation functions between the same pair of cells.

	abstract = {Neural prosthetic interfaces use neural activity related to the planning and perimovement epochs of arm reaching to afford brain-directed control of external devices. Previous research has primarily centered on accurately decoding movement intention from either plan or perimovement activity, but has assumed that temporal boundaries between these epochs are known to the decoding system. In this work, we develop a technique to automatically differentiate between baseline, plan, and perimovement epochs of neural activity. Specifically, we use a generative model of neural activity to capture how neural activity varies between these three epochs. Our approach is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM), in which the latent variable (state) corresponds to the epoch of neural activity, coupled with a state-dependent Poisson firing model. Using an HMM, we demonstrate that the time of transition from baseline to plan epochs, a transition in neural activity that is not accompanied by any external behavior changes, can be detected using a threshold on the a posteriori HMM state probabilities. Following detection of the plan epoch, we show that the intended target of a center-out movement can be detected about as accurately as that by a maximum-likelihood estimator using a window of known plan activity. In addition, we demonstrate that our HMM can detect transitions in neural activity corresponding to targets not found in training data. Thus the HMM technique for automatically detecting transitions between epochs of neural activity enables prosthetic interfaces that can operate autonomously.},

The signatures of this process may be observable in electrophysiological data; yet robust modeling of rapidly changing functional network structure on rapid cognitive timescales remains a considerable challenge. Here, we present one potential solution using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which are able to identify brain states characterized by engaging distinct functional networks that reoccur over time. We show how the HMM can be inferred on continuous, parcellated source-space Magnetoencephalography (MEG) task data in an unsupervised manner, without any knowledge of the task timings. We apply this to a freely available MEG dataset in which participants completed a face perception task, and reveal task-dependent HMM states that represent whole-brain dynamic networks transiently bursting at millisecond time scales as cognition unfolds. The analysis pipeline demonstrates a general way in which the HMM can be used to do a statistically valid whole-brain, group-level task analysis on MEG task data, which could be readily adapted to a wide range of task-based studies.},

	abstract = {Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist commonly used to maintain general anesthesia. At anesthetic doses, ketamine causes high power gamma (25-50 Hz) oscillations alternating with slow-delta (0.1-4 Hz) oscillations. These dynamics are readily observed in local field potentials (LFPs) of non-human primates (NHPs) and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from human subjects. However, a detailed statistical analysis of these dynamics has not been reported. We characterize ketamine’s neural dynamics using a hidden Markov model (HMM). The HMM observations are sequences of spectral power in seven canonical frequency bands between 0 to 50 Hz, where power is averaged within each band and scaled between 0 and 1. We model the observations as realizations of multivariate beta probability distributions that depend on a discrete-valued latent state process whose state transitions obey Markov dynamics. Using an expectation-maximization algorithm, we fit this beta-HMM to LFP recordings from 2 NHPs, and separately, to EEG recordings from 9 human subjects who received anesthetic doses of ketamine. Our beta-HMM framework provides a useful tool for experimental data analysis. Together, the estimated beta-HMM parameters and optimal state trajectory revealed an alternating pattern of states characterized primarily by gamma and slow-delta activities. The mean duration of the gamma activity was 2.2s([1.7,2.8]s) and 1.2s([0.9,1.5]s) for the two NHPs, and 2.5s([1.7,3.6]s) for the human subjects. The mean duration of the slow-delta activity was 1.6s([1.2,2.0]s) and 1.0s([0.8,1.2]s) for the two NHPs, and 1.8s([1.3,2.4]s) for the human subjects. Our characterizations of the alternating gamma slow-delta activities revealed five sub-states that show regular sequential transitions. These quantitative insights can inform the development of rhythm-generating neuronal circuit models that give mechanistic insights into this phenomenon and how ketamine produces altered states of arousal.},

	abstract = {Electrophysiological recordings of neuronal activity show spontaneous and task-dependent changes in their frequency-domain power spectra. These changes are conventionally interpreted as modulations in the amplitude of underlying oscillations. However, this overlooks the possibility of underlying transient spectral ‘bursts’ or events whose dynamics can map to changes in trial-average spectral power in numerous ways. Under this emerging perspective, a key challenge is to perform burst detection, i.e. to characterise single-trial transient spectral events, in a principled manner. Here, we describe how transient spectral events can be operationalised and estimated using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The HMM overcomes a number of the limitations of the standard amplitude-thresholding approach to burst detection; in that it is able to concurrently detect different types of bursts, each with distinct spectral content, without the need to predefine frequency bands of interest, and does so with less dependence on a priori threshold specification. We describe how the HMM can be used for burst detection and illustrate its benefits on simulated data. Finally, we apply this method to empirical data to detect multiple burst types in a task-MEG dataset, and illustrate how we can compute burst metrics, such as the task-evoked timecourse of burst duration.},

Top-down attention enhanced interareal local state coordination, traversing along the reverse cortical hierarchy. The extent of local state coordination between areas was predictive of behavioral performance.

	abstract = {The classical view on motor control makes a clear distinction between the role of motor cortex in controlling muscles and parietal cortex in processing movement plans and goals. However, the strong parieto-frontal connections argue against such clear-cut separation of function. Modern dynamical approaches revealed that population activity in motor cortex can be captured by a limited number of patterns, called neural states that are preserved across diverse motor behaviors. Whether such dynamics are also present in parietal cortex is unclear. Here, we studied neural dynamics in the primate parietal cortex during arm movements and found three main states temporally coupled to the planning, execution and target holding epochs. Strikingly, as reported recently in motor cortex, execution was subdivided into distinct, arm acceleration- and deceleration-related, states. These results suggest that dynamics across parieto-frontal areas are highly consistent and hint that parietal population activity largely reflects timing constraints while motor actions unfold.},

We show that both existing and novel SEM improvements follow naturally. To demonstrate, we introduce three SEM extensions: least absolute deviation estimation, Bayesian LASSO optimization, and sparse high–dimensional mediation analysis. We provide an implementation of SEM in PyTorch – popular software in the machine learning community – to accelerate development of structural equation models adequate for modern–day data and research questions.},

The present study examined the impact of depressive symptoms and alcohol craving on proximal alcohol use in patients with co-occurring bipolar disorder and alcohol dependence. Methods: Data were collected during an 8-week randomized controlled trial of acamprosate for individuals with co-occurring bipolar disorder and alcohol dependence (n = 30). Depressive symptoms and alcohol craving were assessed biweekly using the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS), respectively. Daily alcohol use data were available via administration of the Time-line Follow-back interview at baseline and at subsequent weekly study visits. Correlational analyses and hidden Markov modeling were used to examine the prospective relationships between depressive symptoms, alcohol craving, and alcohol use. Results: Depressive symptoms and alcohol craving were significantly correlated with proximal (i.e., 1 week later) alcohol use across a variety of alcohol consumption summary measures. In hidden Markov models, depressive symptoms (OR = 1.3, 95\% credible interval = [1.1, 1.5]) and alcohol craving (OR = 1.6, 95\% credible interval = [1.4, 1.9]) significantly predicted transitioning from a light to a heavy drinking state, or remaining in a heavy drinking state. Conclusions: The results from the present study suggest that depressive symptoms and alcohol craving increase proximal risk for alcohol use in individuals with co-occurring bipolar and alcohol use disorders.},

	abstract = {This paper assesses the options available to researchers analysing multilevel (including longitudinal) data, with the aim of supporting good methodological decision-making. Given the confusion in the literature about the key properties of fixed and random effects (FE and RE) models, we present these models’ capabilities and limitations. We also discuss the within-between RE model, sometimes misleadingly labelled a ‘hybrid’ model, showing that it is the most general of the three, with all the strengths of the other two. As such, and because it allows for important extensions—notably random slopes—we argue it should be used (as a starting point at least) in all multilevel analyses. We develop the argument through simulations, evaluating how these models cope with some likely mis-specifications. These simulations reveal that (1) failing to include random slopes can generate anti-conservative standard errors, and (2) assuming random intercepts are Normally distributed, when they are not, introduces only modest biases. These results strengthen the case for the use of, and need for, these models.},

	abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models are powerful tools for analysing complex datasets with repeated or clustered observations, a common data structure in ecology and evolution. Mixed-effects models involve complex fitting procedures and make several assumptions, in particular about the distribution of residual and random effects. Violations of these assumptions are common in real datasets, yet it is not always clear how much these violations matter to accurate and unbiased estimation. Here we address the consequences of violations in distributional assumptions and the impact of missing random effect components on model estimates. In particular, we evaluate the effects of skewed, bimodal and heteroscedastic random effect and residual variances, of missing random effect terms and of correlated fixed effect predictors. We focus on bias and prediction error on estimates of fixed and random effects. Model estimates were usually robust to violations of assumptions, with the exception of slight upward biases in estimates of random effect variance if the generating distribution was bimodal but was modelled by Gaussian error distributions. Further, estimates for (random effect) components that violated distributional assumptions became less precise but remained unbiased. However, this particular problem did not affect other parameters of the model. The same pattern was found for strongly correlated fixed effects, which led to imprecise, but unbiased estimates, with uncertainty estimates reflecting imprecision. Unmodelled sources of random effect variance had predictable effects on variance component estimates. The pattern is best viewed as a cascade of hierarchical grouping factors. Variances trickle down the hierarchy such that missing higher-level random effect variances pool at lower levels and missing lower-level and crossed random effect variances manifest as residual variance. Overall, our results show remarkable robustness of mixed-effects models that should allow researchers to use mixed-effects models even if the distributional assumptions are objectively violated. However, this does not free researchers from careful evaluation of the model. Estimates that are based on data that show clear violations of key assumptions should be treated with caution because individual datasets might give highly imprecise estimates, even if they will be unbiased on average across datasets.},

Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

To address this question, we generated a population dataset based on a study in the field of educational psychology, consisting of 3000 classrooms (level-3) with 55000 students (level-2) measured at 5 occasions (level-1), including predictors on each level and interaction effects. Drawing from this data, we realized 1000 random samples each for various sample and missing value conditions and compared analysis results with the true population parameters. We found that sampling at least 15 level-2 units each in 35 level-3 units results in unbiased fixed effects estimates, whereas higher-level random effects variance estimates require larger samples. Overall, increasing the level-2 sample size most strongly improves estimation soundness. We further discuss how data characteristics influence parameter estimation and provide specific sample size recommendations.},

	abstract = {Mixed-effects models have emerged as the gold standard of statistical analysis in different sub-fields of linguistics (Baayen, Davidson \& Bates, 2008; Johnson, 2009; Barr, et al, 2013; Gries, 2015). One problematic feature of these models is their failure to converge under maximal (or even near-maximal) random effects structures. The lack of convergence is relatively unaddressed in linguistics and when it is addressed has resulted in statistical practices (e.g. Jaeger, 2009; Gries, 2015; Bates, et al, 2015b) that are premised on the idea that non-convergence is an indication that a random effects structure is over-specified (or not parsimonious), the parsimonious convergence hypothesis (PCH). We test the PCH by running simulations in lme4 under two sets of assumptions for both a linear dependent variable and a binary dependent variable in order to assess the rate of non-convergence for both types of mixed effects models when a known maximal effect structure is used to generate the data (i.e. when non-convergence cannot be explained by random effects with zero variance). Under the PCH, lack of convergence is treated as evidence against a more maximal random effects structure, but that result is not upheld with our simulations. We provide an alternative model, fully specified Bayesian models implemented in rstan (Stan Development Team, 2016; Carpenter, et al, in press) that removed the convergence problems almost entirely in simulations of the same conditions. These results indicate that when there is known non-zero variance for all slopes and intercepts, under realistic distributions of data and with moderate to severe imbalance, mixed effects models in lme4 have moderate to high non-convergence rates which can cause linguistic researchers to wrongfully exclude random effect terms.},

Biologists therefore use statistical analyses to detect signal among this systemic noise. Statistical models infer trends, find functional relationships and detect differences that exist among groups or are caused by experimental manipulations. They also use statistical relationships to help predict uncertain futures. All branches of the biological sciences now embrace the possibilities of mixed-effects modelling and its flexible toolkit for partitioning noise and signal. The mixed-effects model is not, however, a panacea for poor experimental design, and should be used with caution when inferring or deducing the importance of both fixed and random effects. Here we describe a selection of the perils and pitfalls that are widespread in the biological literature, but can be avoided by careful reflection, modelling and model-checking. We focus on situations where incautious modelling risks exposure to these pitfalls and the drawing of incorrect conclusions. Our stance is that statements of significance, information content or credibility all have their place in biological research, as long as these statements are cautious and well-informed by checks on the validity of assumptions. Our intention is to reveal potential perils and pitfalls in mixed model estimation so that researchers can use these powerful approaches with greater awareness and confidence.

              Background
              Although bipolar disorder (BD) is a fundamentally cyclical illness, a divided model of BD that emphasizes polarity over cyclicity has dominated modern psychiatric diagnostic systems since their advent in the 1980s. However, there has been a gradual return to conceptualizations of BD which focus on longitudinal course in the research community due to emerging supportive data. Advances in longitudinal statistical methods promise to further progress the field.
            
            
              Methods
              
                The current study employed hidden Markov modeling to uncover empirically derived manic and depressive states from longitudinal data [i.e. Young Mania Rating Scale and Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale responses across five occasions from the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) study], estimate participants’ probabilities of transitioning between these states over time (
                n
                = 3918), and evaluate whether clinical variables (e.g. rapid cycling and substance dependence) predict participants’ state transitions (
                n
                = 3229).
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Analyses identified three empirically derived mood states (‘euthymic,’ ‘depressed,’ and ‘mixed’). Relative to the euthymic and depressed states, the mixed state was less commonly experienced, more temporally unstable, and uniquely associated with rapid cycling, substance use, and psychosis. Individuals assigned to the mixed state at baseline were relatively less likely to be diagnosed with BD-II (
                v
                . BD-I), more likely to present with a mixed or (hypo)manic episode, and reported experiencing irritable and elevated mood more frequently.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              The results from the current study represent an important step in defining, and characterizing the longitudinal course of, empirically derived mood states that can be used to form the foundation of objective, empirical attempts to define meaningful subtypes of affective illness defined by clinical course.},

Both groups rely upon certain assumptions, with most considering only aggregate scores on clinical instruments. In this study, we propose a novel framework that combines elements from both discrete and continuous mood models, using a machine learning pipeline to detect subtle patterns across individuals. Latent factors are constructed from assessments at the item level, then clustered into groups referred to as microstates. Transitions between microstates are captured via a discrete-time Markov chain, allowing for characterization of mood's dynamic nature. Key findings include a factor mapping heavily onto irritability and aggression, as well as a hierarchical pattern of microstates within depression and mania. Validity of these results is confirmed by reproduction in an unseen data set from a separate subject cohort.},

	abstract = {This article considers explicit and detailed theoretical and empirical Bayesian analysis of the well-known Poisson regression model for count data with unobserved individual effects based on the lognormal, rather than the popular negative binomial distribution. Although the negative binomial distribution leads to analytical expressions for the likelihood function, a Poisson-lognormal model is closer to the concept of regression with normally distributed innovations, and accounts for excess zeros as well. Such models have been considered widely in the literature (Winkelmann, 2008). The article also provides the necessary theoretical results regarding the posterior distribution of the model. Given that the likelihood function involves integrals with respect to the latent variables, numerical methods organized around Gibbs sampling with data augmentation are proposed for likelihood analysis of the model. The methods are applied to the patent-R\&D relationship of 70 US pharmaceutical and biomedical companies, and it is found that it performs better than Poisson regression or negative binomial regression models.},

This article introduces an analogous tool for longitudinal studies: MI using Bayesian mixture Latent Markov (BMLM) models. Besides retaining the benefits of latent class models, i.e. respecting the (categorical) measurement scale of the variables and preserving possibly complex relationships between variables within a measurement occasion, the Markov dependence structure of the proposed BMLM model allows capturing lagged dependencies between adjacent time points, while the time-constant mixture structure allows capturing dependencies across all time points, as well as retrieving associations between time-varying and time-constant variables. The performance of the BMLM model for MI is evaluated by means of a simulation study and an empirical experiment, in which it is compared with complete case analysis and MICE. Results show good performance of the proposed method in retrieving the parameters of the analysis model. In contrast, competing methods could provide correct estimates only for some aspects of the data.},

The pathology of Alzheimer’s disease usually evolves from cognitive normal, to mild cognitive impairment, to Alzheimer’s disease. The aim of this paper is to develop a Bayesian hidden Markov model to characterize disease pathology, identify hidden states corresponding to the diagnosed stages of cognitive decline, and examine the dynamic changes of potential risk factors associated with the cognitive normal–mild cognitive impairment–Alzheimer’s disease transition. The hidden Markov model framework consists of two major components. The first one is a state-dependent semiparametric regression for delineating the complex associations between clinical outcomes of interest and a set of prognostic biomarkers across neurodegenerative states. The second one is a parametric transition model, while accounting for potential covariate effects on the cross-state transition. The inter-individual and inter-process differences are taken into account via correlated random effects in both components. Based on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data set, we are able to identify four states of Alzheimer’s disease pathology, corresponding to common diagnosed cognitive decline stages, including cognitive normal, early mild cognitive impairment, late mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer’s disease and examine the effects of hippocampus, age, gender, and APOE-𝜀4ε4{\textless}math display="inline" id="mml-math1-0962280217748675" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00001.gif"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}ε{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mn{\textgreater}4{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} on degeneration of cognitive function across the four cognitive states.},

	abstract = {Cocaine is a type of drug that functions to increase the availability of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain. However, cocaine dependence or abuse is highly related to an increased risk of psychiatric disorders and deficits in cognitive performance, attention, and decision-making abilities. Given the chronic and persistent features of drug addiction, the progression of abstaining from cocaine often evolves across several states, such as addiction to, moderate dependence on, and swearing off cocaine. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are well suited to the characterization of longitudinal data in terms of a set of unobservable states, and have increasingly been used to uncover the dynamic heterogeneity in progressive diseases or activities. However, the existence of outliers or influential points may misidentify the hidden states and distort the associated inference. In this study, we develop a Bayesian local influence procedure for HMMs with latent variables in the presence of missing data. The proposed model enables us to investigate the dynamic heterogeneity of multivariate longitudinal data, reveal how the interrelationships among latent variables change from one state to another, and simultaneously conduct statistical diagnosis for the given data, model assumptions, and prior inputs. We apply the proposed procedure to analyze a dataset collected by the UCLA center for advancing longitudinal drug abuse research. Several outliers or influential points that seriously influence estimation results are identified and removed. The proposed procedure also discovers the effects of treatment and individuals’ psychological problems on cocaine use behavior and delineates their dynamic changes across the cocaine-addiction states.},

Of particular interest is the case where the missing mechanism is non-ignorable. To deal with the topic we introduce a conditional to dropout model. A shape change in the random effects distribution is considered by directly modeling the effect of the missing data process on the evolution of the latent structure. To estimate the resulting model, we rely on the conditional maximum likelihood approach and for this aim we outline an EM algorithm. The proposal is illustrated via simulations and then applied on a dataset concerning skin cancers. Comparisons with other well-established methods are provided as well.},

Recently, it has be been extended to the analysis of longitudinal continuous outcomes using either time-constant or time-varying random parameters. However, in real-life data, we frequently observe both temporal shocks in the overall trend and individual-specific heterogeneity in model parameters. A benchmark dataset on HIV progression gives a clear example. Here, the evolution of the CD4 log counts exhibits both sudden temporal changes in the overall trend and heterogeneity in the effect of the time since seroconversion on the response dynamics. To accommodate such situations, we propose a quantile regression model, where time-varying and time-constant random coefficients are jointly considered. Since observed data may be incomplete due to early drop-out, we also extend the proposed model in a pattern mixture perspective. We assess the performance of the proposals via a large-scale simulation study and the analysis of the CD4 count data.},

	abstract = {A Bayesian approach for calibrating a hidden Markov model (HMM) to long-term multi-site rainfall time series is presented. Using a HMM approach for simulating long-term persistence is attractive because it has an explicit mechanism to produce long-term wet and dry periods which are a feature of many long-term hydrological time series. The ability to fully evaluate parameter uncertainty for the multi-site HMM represents an advance in the stochastic modelling of long-term persistence in multi-site hydrological time series. The challenges in applying the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method known as the Gibbs sampler to infer the posterior distribution of the multi-site HMM parameters are fully outlined. The specification of appropriate prior distributions was found to be crucial for the successful implementation of the Gibbs sampler. It is described how using synthetic data led to the development of an appropriate prior specification. Further synthetic data analysis showed how the benefits of space-for-time substitution for identifying the long-term persistence structure are dependent on the spatial correlation that exists in multi-site data. A methodology for handling missing data is also described. This study highlights the important role of the priors in Bayesian analysis using MCMC methods by illustrating that misleading inferences can result if the priors are inappropriately specified.},

	abstract = {Discrete-time hidden Markov models (HMMs) have become an immensely popular tool for inferring latent animal behaviours from telemetry data. While movement HMMs typically rely solely on location data (e.g. step length and turning angle), auxiliary biotelemetry and environmental data are powerful and readily-available resources for incorporating much more ecological and behavioural realism. However, complex movement or observation process models often necessitate custom and computationally demanding HMM model-fitting techniques that are impractical for most practitioners, and there is a paucity of generalized user-friendly software available for implementing multivariate HMMs of animal movement. Here, we introduce an open-source R package, momentuHMM, that addresses many of the deficiencies in existing HMM software. Features include: (1) data pre-processing and visualization; (2) user-specified probability distributions for an unlimited number of data streams and latent behaviour states; (3) biased and correlated random walk movement models, including dynamic “activity centres” associated with attractive or repulsive forces; (4) user-specified design matrices and constraints for covariate modelling of parameters using formulas familiar to most R users; (5) multiple imputation methods that account for measurement error and temporally irregular or missing data; (6) seamless integration of spatio-temporal covariate raster data; (7) cosinor and spline models for cyclical and other complicated patterns; (8) model checking and selection; and (9) simulation. After providing an overview of the main features of the package, we demonstrate some of the capabilities of momentuHMM using real-world examples. These include models for cyclical movement patterns of African elephants, foraging trips of northern fur seals, loggerhead turtle movements relative to ocean surface currents, and grey seal movements among three activity centres. momentuHMM considerably extends the capabilities of existing HMM software while accounting for common challenges associated with telemetry data. It therefore facilitates more realistic hypothesis-driven animal movement analyses that have hitherto been largely inaccessible to non-statisticians. While motivated by telemetry data, the package can be used for analysing any type of data that is amenable to HMMs. Practitioners interested in additional features are encouraged to contact the authors.},

Recent applications in the field of psychosomatic research have provided insights into the dynamical nature of the relationship between somatic symptoms, physiological measures, and emotional states. These promising results highlight the intrinsic value of employing time series analysis, although application comes with some important challenges. This paper aims to present an approachable, non-technical overview of the state of the art on these challenges and the solutions that have been proposed, with emphasis on application towards psychosomatic hypotheses. Specifically, we elaborate on issues related to measurement intervals, the number and nature of the variables used in the analysis, modeling stable and changing processes, concurrent relationships, and extending time series analysis to incorporate the data of multiple individuals. We also briefly discuss some general modeling issues, such as lag-specification, sample size and time series length, and the role of measurement errors. We hope to arm applied researchers with an overview from which to select appropriate techniques from the ever growing variety of time series analysis approaches.},

	abstract = {Background
It is increasingly recognized that existing diagnostic approaches do not capture the underlying heterogeneity and complexity of psychiatric disorders such as depression. This study uses a data-driven approach to define fluid depressive states and explore how patients transition between these states in response to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).

Methods
Item-level Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) data were collected from 9891 patients with a diagnosis of depression, at each CBT treatment session. Latent Markov modelling was used on these data to define depressive states and explore transition probabilities between states. Clinical outcomes and patient demographics were compared between patients starting at different depressive states.

Results
A model with seven depressive states emerged as the best compromise between optimal fit and interpretability. States loading preferentially on cognitive/affective v. somatic symptoms of depression were identified. Analysis of transition probabilities revealed that patients in cognitive/affective states do not typically transition towards somatic states and vice-versa. Post-hoc analyses also showed that patients who start in a somatic depressive state are less likely to engage with or improve with therapy. These patients are also more likely to be female, suffer from a comorbid long-term physical condition and be taking psychotropic medication.

Conclusions
This study presents a novel approach for depression sub-typing, defining fluid depressive states and exploring transitions between states in response to CBT. Understanding how different symptom profiles respond to therapy will inform the development and delivery of stratified treatment protocols, improving clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of psychological therapies for patients with depression.},

Eight health and information technology research databases were searched for papers covering this domain. Articles were assessed by two reviewers, and data were extracted on the article's mental health application, ML technique, data type, and study results. Articles were then synthesised via narrative review.ResultsThree hundred papers focusing on the application of ML to mental health were identified. Four main application domains emerged in the literature, including: (i) detection and diagnosis; (ii) prognosis, treatment and support; (iii) public health, and; (iv) research and clinical administration. The most common mental health conditions addressed included depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. ML techniques used included support vector machines, decision trees, neural networks, latent Dirichlet allocation, and clustering.ConclusionsOverall, the application of ML to mental health has demonstrated a range of benefits across the areas of diagnosis, treatment and support, research, and clinical administration. With the majority of studies identified focusing on the detection and diagnosis of mental health conditions, it is evident that there is significant room for the application of ML to other areas of psychology and mental health. The challenges of using ML techniques are discussed, as well as opportunities to improve and advance the field.},

	abstract = {Background
               Evidence supporting the continuous latent structure of mood phenomena has not been incorporated into psychiatric diagnostic systems, in part because the evidence has been incomplete. For example, no studies have investigated the boundary between ‘sick’ and ‘well’ periods in individuals with bipolar disorder, despite agreement that characterization of mood disorders as having a discrete episodic course is inaccurate. The present study examined the validity of mood episode symptom thresholds in out-patients with bipolar disorder using multiple methodologies: taxometrics and information-theoretic latent distribution modeling (ITLDM), to evaluate the continuity/discontinuity of mood symptoms; and structural equation mixture modeling (SEMM), to evaluate the continuity/discontinuity of associations between mood symptoms and general functioning.
            
            
               Method
               A total of 3721 out-patients with bipolar disorder from the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) were available for analysis. Data were collected at participants’ baseline STEP-BD visit. Taxometric [maximum covariance/means above minus below a cut (MAXCOV/MAMBAC) with simulated comparison data], ITLDM and SEMM methods were applied twice, once to the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and again to the Young Mania Rating Scale.
            
            
               Results
               Taxometric results unequivocally supported a continuous interpretation of the data. ITLDM results favored many valued ‘discrete metrical’ models, suggesting that mood symptoms have continuous, but potentially non-normally distributed, latent structures in out-patients with bipolar disorder. Finally, SEMM results demonstrated that latent associations between mood symptoms and general functioning were linear.
            
            
               Conclusions
               Results from the present study argue against the validity of DSM mood episode thresholds and argue for a graded continuum of care of bipolar symptom management.},

	abstract = {Background
Sleep disturbances are important symptoms to monitor in people with bipolar disorder (BD) but the precise longitudinal relationships between sleep and mood remain unclear. We aimed to examine associations between stable and dynamic aspects of sleep and mood in people with BD, and assess individual differences in the strength of these associations.

Methods
Participants (N = 649) with BD-I (N = 400) and BD-II (N = 249) provided weekly self-reports of insomnia, depression and (hypo)mania symptoms using the True Colours online monitoring tool for 21 months. Dynamic structural equation models were used to examine the interplay between weekly reports of insomnia and mood. The effects of clinical and demographic characteristics on associations were also assessed.

Results
Increased variability in insomnia symptoms was associated with increased mood variability. In the sample as a whole, we found strong evidence of bidirectional relationships between insomnia and depressive symptoms but only weak support for bidirectional relationships between insomnia and (hypo)manic symptoms. We found substantial variability between participants in the strength of prospective associations between insomnia and mood, which depended on age, gender, bipolar subtype, and a history of rapid cycling.

Conclusions
Our results highlight the importance of monitoring sleep in people with BD. However, researchers and clinicians investigating the association between sleep and mood should consider subgroup differences in this relationship. Advances in digital technology mean that intensive longitudinal data on sleep and mood are becoming increasingly available. Novel methods to analyse these data present an exciting opportunity for furthering our understanding of BD.},

The dual aims of this study were to prospectively investigate: (a) the trajectory of QoL under guideline-driven treatment and (b) the dynamic relationship between mood symptoms and QoL.MethodsIn total, 362 patients with BD receiving guideline-driven treatment were prospectively followed at 3-month intervals for up to 5 years. Mental (Mental Component Score – MCS) and physical (Physical Component Score – PCS) QoL were measured using the self-report SF-36. Clinician-rated symptom data were recorded for mania and depression. Multilevel modelling was used to analyse MCS and PCS over time, QoL trajectories predicted by time-lagged symptoms, and symptom trajectories predicted by time-lagged QoL.ResultsMCS exhibited a positive trajectory, while PCS worsened over time. Investigation of temporal relationships between QoL and symptoms suggested bidirectional effects: earlier depressive symptoms were negatively associated with mental QoL, and earlier manic symptoms were negatively associated with physical QoL. Importantly, earlier MCS and PCS were both negatively associated with downstream symptoms of mania and depression.ConclusionsThe present investigation illustrates real-world outcomes for QoL under guideline-driven BD treatment: improvements in mental QoL and decrements in physical QoL were observed. The data permitted investigation of dynamic interactions between QoL and symptoms, generating novel evidence for bidirectional effects and encouraging further research into this important interplay. Investigation of relevant time-varying covariates (e.g. medications) was beyond scope. Future research should investigate possible determinants of QoL and the interplay between symptoms and wellbeing/satisfaction-centric measures of QoL.},

Respondents were examined by clinical interviewers with the DSM-IV Composite International Diagnostic Interview (DIA-X/M-CIDI). Functional disability, i.e. number of disability days in the past 4 weeks, and QoL, i.e. mental (MCS) and physical (PCS) component scale of the SF-36V2, were examined in subjects with 12-month mental disorders (= active cases [AC]) and compared to (a) subjects who never met diagnostic criteria (= unaffected individuals [UAI]), and (b) those with a history of mental disorders but not meeting the diagnostic criteria in the past 12 months (= non-active cases [NAC]; partially or fully remitted).ResultsIn comparison to UAI (mean: 1.9), AC reveals a 2–3 fold disability days/month (5.4, P {\textless} .001) and a substantially reduced MCS (UAI: 52.1; AC: 43.3, P {\textless} .001). NAC had a similar number of disability days as UAI, but significantly reduced MCS scores (49.9; P {\textless} .001). Disability days and QoL decrements were highest in internalizing disorders including somatoform disorders and most pronounced in comorbid cases.ConclusionsBy and large, findings of a previous study were confirmed and extended for this nationally representative German sample. 12-month mental disorders, particularly internalizing, including somatoform disorders, are associated with high levels of disability and increased health-related QoL decrements. Partial or complete remission of the mental disorders is associated with a normalization of the numbers of disability days.},

	abstract = {Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a major public health problem. In time series count data there may be over dispersion, and serial dependency. In such situation some models that can consider the dependency are needed. The purpose current research was to use Poisson hidden Markov model to forecast new monthly BD instances.
Methods: In current study the dataset including the frequency of new instances of BD from October 2008 to March 2015 in Hamadan Province, the west of Iran were used. We used Poisson hidden Markov with different number of conditions to determine the best model according to Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Then we used final model to forecast for the next 24 months.
Results: Poisson hidden Markov with two states were chosen as the final model. Each component of dependent mixture model explained one of the states. The results showed that the new BD cases is increase over time and due to forecasting results number of patients for the next 24 months comforted in state two with mean 85.15. The forecast interval was approximately (56, 100).
Conclusion:As the Poisson hidden Markov models was not used to forecast the future states in other prior researches, the findings of this study set forward a forecasting strategy as an alternative to common methods, by considering its deficiencies.},

	abstract = {Markov and hidden Markov models (HMMs) provide a special angle to characterize trajectories using their state transition patterns. Distinct from Markov models, HMMs assume that an unobserved sequence governs the observed sequence and the Markovian property is imposed on the hidden chain rather than the observed one. In the first part of this dissertation, we develop a model for HMMs with exponential family distribution and extend it to incorporate covariates. We call it HMM-GLM, for which we propose a joint model selection method. The proposed selection criterion is tailored for HMM-GLM aiming at a more accurate approximation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence; we seek improvement of the widely-used Akaike information criterion. The second and the third parts of this dissertation are about clustering trajectories with HMMs and Markov mixture models. The research interests for HMM clustering are to develop a less computationally expensive and more interpretable algorithm for HMM sequence clustering problem, based on the emission and transition features of the chains. We propose an efficient clustering method using Bhattacharyya affinity to measure the pairwise similarity between sequences and apply a spectral clustering algorithm to obtain the cluster assignment. The computational efficiency benefits from the fact that our method avoids iterative computation for the affinity of a pair of sequences. Meanwhile, both simulation and empirical studies show that the proposed algorithm maintains good performance compared to other similar methods. In the third part of the dissertation, we address a study of the course of children and adolescents with bipolar disorder.  Measuring and making sense of the fluctuations in different moods over time is challenging.  We use a Markov mixture model with different transition matrices to find homogeneous clusters and capture different longitudinal mood change patterns. We also conduct a simulation study to investigate the performance of the model when there are violations of model assumptions. The results show that this model is fairly robust in the tested situations. We find that the clusters separate out those who tend to stay in a mood state from those who fluctuate between mood states more frequently.},

	abstract = {The pathological mechanisms of major depressive disorders (MDDs) is associated with the overexpression of negative emotions, and the fast transient-activated patterns underlying overrepresentation in depression still remain to be revealed to date. We hypothesized that the aberrant spatiotemporal attributes of the process of sad expressions are related to the neuropathology of MDD and help to detect the depression severity. We enrolled a total of 96 subjects including 47 patients with MDD and 49 healthy controls (HCs), and recorded their magnetoencephalography data under a sad expression recognition task. A hidden Markov model (HMM) was applied to separate the whole neural activity into several brain states, then to characterize the dynamics. To find the disrupted temporal–spatial characteristics, power estimations and fractional occupancy (FO) of each state were estimated and contrasted between MDDs and HCs. Three states were found over the period of emotional stimuli processing procedure. The early visual stage (0–270 ms) was mainly manifested by state 1, and the emotional information processing stage (270–600 ms) was manifested by state 2, while the state 3 remained a steady proportion across the whole period. MDDs activated statistically more in limbic system during state 2 (p = 0.0045) and less in frontoparietal control network during state 3 (p = 5.38 × 10–5) relative to HCs. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores were significantly correlated with the predicted disorder severity using FO values (p = 0.0062, r = 0.3933). Relative to HCs, MDDs perceived the sad contents quickly and spent more time overexpressing the negative emotions. These phenomena indicated MDD patients might easily indulge in negative emotion and neglect other things. Furthermore, temporal descriptors built by HMM could be potential biomarkers for identifying the severity of depression disorders.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}It is estimated that half of the health issues in the United Kingdom are linked to mental health for individuals under the age of 65, with the majority of these health issues being attributed to depression or anxiety. One of the most prevalent mental disorders is bipolar disorder, with patients experiencing mood instability with extended periods of depression, associated with feelings of unhappiness and dejection. They also experience periods of mania, associated with euphoria, delusions and overactivity. Borderline personality disorder is the most common personality disorder and is linked with disrupted mood and altered personal interactions. Current clinical practice in the management of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder involves self-reported monitoring and interviews with clinicians. This practice is based on research focused on clinical laboratory settings and single modality sensors to record data. Smartphones and mobile devices allow for at home monitoring in a natural setting and can acquire multiple signal modalities over very long periods of time, thus providing more information about the links between behaviour and physiology in mental health disorders. These objective measures could provide passive measures of sleep and circadian rhythms which could be used to determine the health of patients at home. This thesis explores the relationship between circadian rhythms, mood symptoms and depression within individuals and patient groups. {\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}A longitudinal study of 141 individuals, including bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder and healthy control participants, monitored behavioural, physiological and mood measures for a mean of 83±31 weeks. Circadian features of activity and heart rate, in addition to measures of sleep were extracted from the signals through fitting of sinusoids and application of time varying hidden Markov models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Internal desynchronisation of circadian rhythms were investigated through differences in the phase of the rhythms of a four day period. Significant desynchronisation between the rhythms of heart rate and both activity and sleep were seen in the patients groups. Borderline personality disorder participants had the greatest desynchrony with a three hour lag between heart rate and activity and one hour between heart rate and sleep.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The variability of circadian rhythms in healthy mood states, known as euthymia, were greatest in the borderline personality disorder patients, with bipolar disorderparticipants also having more variable sleep. Significant correlations were seen between circadian variability and mood variability in borderline personality disorder participants. The variability in activity rhythms correlated strongly with negative mood (ρ = 0.819, p = 0.04) in addition to the variability in heart rate amplitudes and negative mood (ρ = 0.852, p = 0.02).{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}New features of circadian activity and sleep were extracted from longitudinal smartphone accelerometry using time varying hidden Markov models. Personalised regression models were developed which are capable of predicting levels of depression, with average mean absolute errors of depression scores (ranging from 0 to 27) of 0.80 ± 0.79 in bipolar disorder participants, 1.33 ± 1.03 in borderline personality disorder participants, and 0.39 ± 0.40 in healthy control participants. These errors are smaller than the thresholds for diagnosing episodes of depression (0 − 5 {\textless}em{\textgreater}no depression{\textless}/em{\textgreater}, 6 − 10 {\textless}em{\textgreater}mild depression{\textless}/em{\textgreater}, 11 − 15 {\textless}em{\textgreater}moderate depression{\textless}/em{\textgreater}, and \&gt; 15 {\textless}em{\textgreater}severe depression{\textless}/em{\textgreater}), with bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder participants entering all levels of depression, but healthy controls remaining mainly in the no depression category. The personalised regression models developed were able to classify depression with an accuracy of 88\% in bipolar disorder, 79\% in borderline personality disorder, and 98\% in healthy participants.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The results presented in this thesis show both bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder to be associated with disrupted circadian rhythms. A major finding of this thesis is that the quantification of circadian rhythm disruption may be performed over a short-term high intensity period, reducing the need for multiple obtrusive devices to be worn over long periods of time, with shorter term monitoring have less barriers for adoption in to clinical practice. It was also found that the use of multiple modalities (acceleration and heart rate) allows for novel desynchronisation metrics to be performed, which are not possible from single sensor recordings, providing further insight into the levels of illness.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The findings also highlight the relationship between mood and circadian rhythms and show longitudinal monitoring of acceleration may act as an objective marker to aid monitoring of symptoms of depression. Due to the activity being recorded from smartphones, which are already in widespread use in current society, there is a reduction in the barriers to uptake for patients to begin using these monitoring tools. These markers of circadian activity may have a considerable impact in the future of clinical care through providing automated objective measures to compliment the current clinical practice and reduce some of the subjectivity in diagnosis and monitoring of depression.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, a number of models of mood have emerged to describe the pathological fluctuation in mood that is characteristic of this disorder. These models are surprisingly diverse in their dynamical principles, e.g. whether mood is periodic or whether mania and depression are stable points when ignoring external influences. This chapters presents a selective summary of existing models of mood in bipolar disorder and introduces two new models. We focus on a key question: how to differentiate between models when only time courses of mood are available. For each model we consider, time courses are evaluated through data transformations and statistical techniques, including estimating survival functions and spectral density. We then provide guidelines on how to decide whether a certain modeling assumption, e.g. periodicity, is appropriate.},

The initial diagnosis of schizophrenia was not likely to change for two of every three patients if it was confirmed some months after its onset. When not confirmed, the most frequent alternative diagnoses were personality, affective or non-schizophrenia psychotic disorders. Misdiagnosis or comorbidity with affective, anxiety and personality disorders are frequent before and after the diagnosis of schizophrenia.

In this paper, we introduce a system, which, based on smartphone-sensing is able to recognize depressive and manic states and detect state changes of patients suffering from bipolar disorder. Drawing upon a real-life dataset of ten patients, recorded over a time period of 12 weeks (in total over 800 days of data tracing 17 state changes) by four different sensing modalities, we could extract features corresponding to all disease-relevant aspects in behavior. Using these features, we gain recognition accuracies of 76\% by fusing all sensor modalities and state change detection precision and recall of over 97\%. This paper furthermore outlines the applicability of this system in the physician-patient relations in order to facilitate the life and treatment of bipolar patients.},

We sought to validate a new survey that is brief, validated in digital form, and able to separately measure manic and depressive severity. Methods We introduce a 6-item digital survey, called digiBP, for measuring mood in BP. It has three depressive items (depressed mood, fidgeting, fatigue), two manic items (increased energy, rapid speech), and one mixed item (irritability); and recovers two scores (m and d) to measure manic and depressive severity. In a secondary analysis of individuals with BP who monitored their symptoms over 6 weeks (n = 43), we perform a series of analyses to validate the digiBP survey internally, externally, and as a longitudinal measure. Results We first verify a conceptual model for the survey in which items load onto two factors (“manic” and “depressive”). We then show weekly averages of m and d scores from digiBP can explain significant variation in weekly scores from the Young Mania Rating Scale (R2 = 0.47) and SIGH-D (R2 = 0.58). Lastly, we examine the utility of the survey as a longitudinal measure by predicting an individual’s future m and d scores from their past m and d scores. Conclusions While further validation is warranted in larger, diverse populations, these validation analyses should encourage researchers to consider digiBP for their next digital study of BP.},

This review discusses the importance and risks of user engagement, as well as barriers to improving it. Research on mood dynamics highlights the possibility to reveal data-driven computational phenotypes that could guide treatment. Mobile apps are being used to track voice patterns, global positioning system (GPS), and phone usage for predicting mood and treatment response. Future directions include using mobile apps to deliver and evaluate microinterventions. To continue these advances, standardized reporting and study designs should be considered to improve digital solutions for mood disorders.},

	abstract = {The hallmark of bipolar disorder is a clinical course of recurrent manic and depressive symptoms of varying severity and duration. Mathematical modeling of bipolar disorder holds the promise of an ability to personalize diagnoses, to predict future mood episodes, to directly compare diverse datasets, and to link basic mechanisms to behavioral data. Several modeling frameworks have been proposed for bipolar disorder, which represent competing hypothesis about the basic framework of the disorder. Here, we test these hypotheses with self-report assessments of mania and depression symptoms from 178 bipolar patients followed prospectively for 4 or more years. Statistical analysis of the data did not support the hypotheses that mood arises from a rhythmic process or multiple stable states (e.g., mania or depression) or that manic and depressive symptoms are highly anti-correlated. Alternatively, it is shown that bipolar disorder could arise from an inability for mood to quickly return to normal when perturbed. This latter concept is embodied by an affective instability model that can be personalized to the clinical course of any individual with chronic disorders that have an affective component.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Altered emotion dynamics may represent a transdiagnostic risk factor for mood psychopathology. The present study examined whether altered emotion dynamics were associated with bipolar and depressive psychopathology concurrently and at a three-year follow-up.
Methods
At baseline (n = 138), participants completed diagnostic interviews, questionnaires, and seven days of experience sampling assessments. Four emotion dynamics were computed for negative affect (NA) and positive affect (PA) – within-person variance (variability), mean square of successive differences and probability of acute change (instability), and autocorrelation (inertia). At the three-year follow-up, participants (n = 108) were re-assessed via interviews and questionnaires.
Results
NA variability was associated with bipolar spectrum disorders at baseline and follow-up. NA instability predicted depressive symptoms and hypomanic personality at baseline, and bipolar spectrum disorders at the follow-up. NA inertia did not predict diagnoses or symptoms at either assessment. PA inertia predicted hyperthymic temperament at baseline but not follow-up. Notably, NA variability and instability predicted the development of new bipolar spectrum disorders at the follow-up.
Limitations
Consistent with the recruitment strategy and young age of the participants, only 50\% had developed diagnosable psychopathology by the time of the follow-up assessment.
Conclusions
The present study provided a unique demonstration that altered emotion dynamics differentially predicted bipolar and depressive psychopathology concurrently and prospectively. Emotion dynamics are important to both digital phenotyping and mobile-based interventions as emotional instability offers a measurable risk factor that is identifiable prior to illness onset.},

	abstract = {Bipolar disorder (BD) is a complex and dynamic condition with a typical onset in late adolescence or early adulthood followed by an episodic course with intervening periods of subthreshold symptoms or euthymia. It is complicated by the accumulation of comorbid medical and psychiatric disorders. The etiology of BD remains unknown and no reliable biological markers have yet been identified. This is likely due to lack of comprehensive ontological framework and, most importantly, the fact that most studies have been based on small nonrepresentative clinical samples with cross-sectional designs. We propose to establish large, global longitudinal cohorts of BD studied consistently in a multidimensional and multidisciplinary manner to determine etiology and help improve treatment. Herein we propose collection of a broad range of data that reflect the heterogenic phenotypic manifestations of BD that include dimensional and categorical measures of mood, neurocognitive, personality, behavior, sleep and circadian, life-story, and outcomes domains. In combination with genetic and biological information such an approach promotes the integrating and harmonizing of data within and across current ontology systems while supporting a paradigm shift that will facilitate discovery and become the basis for novel hypotheses.},

	abstract = {The pathological mechanisms of major depressive disorders (MDDs) is associated with the overexpression of negative emotions, and the fast transient-activated patterns underlying overrepresentation in depression still remain to be revealed to date. We hypothesized that the aberrant spatiotemporal attributes of the process of sad expressions are related to the neuropathology of MDD and help to detect the depression severity. We enrolled a total of 96 subjects including 47 patients with MDD and 49 healthy controls (HCs), and recorded their magnetoencephalography data under a sad expression recognition task. A hidden Markov model (HMM) was applied to separate the whole neural activity into several brain states, then to characterize the dynamics. To find the disrupted temporal–spatial characteristics, power estimations and fractional occupancy (FO) of each state were estimated and contrasted between MDDs and HCs. Three states were found over the period of emotional stimuli processing procedure. The early visual stage (0–270 ms) was mainly manifested by state 1, and the emotional information processing stage (270–600 ms) was manifested by state 2, while the state 3 remained a steady proportion across the whole period. MDDs activated statistically more in limbic system during state 2 (p = 0.0045) and less in frontoparietal control network during state 3 (p = 5.38 × 10–5) relative to HCs. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores were significantly correlated with the predicted disorder severity using FO values (p = 0.0062, r = 0.3933). Relative to HCs, MDDs perceived the sad contents quickly and spent more time overexpressing the negative emotions. These phenomena indicated MDD patients might easily indulge in negative emotion and neglect other things. Furthermore, temporal descriptors built by HMM could be potential biomarkers for identifying the severity of depression disorders.},

In this study, we focus on descriptive results and qualitative analyses.Results Individuals reported primarily self-monitoring items related to their bipolar disorder (mood, sleep, finances, exercise, and social interactions), with an increasing trend towards the use of digital tracking methods observed. Most participants reported having positive experiences with technology-based tracking because it enables self-reflection and agency regarding health management and also enhances lines of communication with treatment teams. Reported challenges stem from poor usability or difficulty interpreting self-tracked data.Discussion Two major implications for technology-based self-monitoring emerged from our results. First, technologies can be designed to be more condition-oriented, intuitive, and proactive. Second, more automated forms of digital symptom tracking and intervention are desired, and our results suggest the feasibility of detecting and predicting emotional states from patterns of technology usage. However, we also uncovered tension points, namely that technology designed to support mental health can also be a disruptor.Conclusion This study provides increased understanding of self-monitoring practices, attitudes, and needs of individuals with bipolar disorder. This knowledge bears implications for clinical researchers and practitioners seeking insight into how individuals independently self-manage their condition as well as for researchers designing monitoring technologies to support mental health management.},

We examined the incidence of SAs during different phases of BD in a long-term prospective cohort of bipolar I (BD-I) and bipolar II (BD-II) patients, and risk factors specifically for SAs during major depressive episodes (MDEs). Methods In the Jorvi Bipolar Study (JoBS), 191 BD-I and BD-II patients were followed using life-chart methodology. Prospective information on SAs of 177 patients (92.7\%) during different illness phases was available up to 5 years. The incidence of SAs and their predictors were investigated using logistic and Poisson regression models. Analyses of risk factors for SAs occurring during MDEs were conducted using two-level random-intercept logistic regression models. Results During the 5 years of follow-up, 90 SAs per 718 patient-years occurred. The incidence was highest, over 120-fold higher than in euthymia, during mixed states (765/1000 person-years; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 461−1269 person-years), and also very high in MDEs, almost 60-fold higher than in euthymia (354/1000 person-years; 95\% CI 277−451 person-years). For risk of SAs during MDEs, the duration of MDEs, severity of depression, and cluster C personality disorders were significant predictors. Conclusions We confirmed in this long-term study that the highest incidences of SAs occur in mixed and major depressive illness phases. The variations in incidence rates between euthymia and illness phases were remarkably large, suggesting that the question “when” rather than “who” may be more relevant for suicide risk in BD. However, risk during MDEs is likely also influenced by personality factors.},

To do so, HowNutsAreTheDutch (HND) makes use of an internet platform that allows participants to (a) compare themselves to other participants via cross-sectional questionnaires and (b) to monitor themselves three times a day for 30 days with an intensive longitudinal diary study via their smartphone. These data enable for personalized feedback to participants, a study of profiles of mental strengths and weaknesses, and zooming into the fine-grained level of dynamic relationships between variables over time.

	abstract = {Objectives Although cannabis use is common in bipolar disorder and may contribute to worse clinical outcomes, little is understood about the relationship between this drug and bipolar disorder over the course of daily life. The aim of study was to examine the effect of cannabis on affect and bipolar symptoms in a group of individuals with bipolar disorder. Methods Twenty-four participants with bipolar disorder type I or type II completed diaries for 6 days using Experience Sampling Methodology to investigate the temporal associations between cannabis, affect and bipolar disorder symptoms. Results The results indicated that higher levels of positive affect increase the odds of using cannabis (OR:1.25 ,CI:1.06–1.47, P=0.008). However, neither negative affect, manic nor depressive symptoms predicted the use of cannabis. Cannabis use was associated with subsequent increases in positive affect (β=0.35, CI:0.20-0.51, P=0.000), manic symptoms (β=0.20,CI:0.05-0.34, P=0.009) and depressive symptoms (β= 0.17,CI:0.04-0.29, P=0.008). Conclusion The findings indicate that cannabis use is associated with a number of subsequent psychological effects. However there was no evidence that individuals with BD were using cannabis to self-medicate minor fluctuations in negative affect or bipolar disorder symptoms over the course of daily life. The findings in relation to existing literature and clinical implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background
The 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS), a new measure of depressive symptom severity derived from the 30-item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS), is available in both self-report (QIDS-SR16) and clinician-rated (QIDS-C16) formats.
Methods
This report evaluates and compares the psychometric properties of the QIDS-SR16 in relation to the IDS-SR30 and the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D24) in 596 adult outpatients treated for chronic nonpsychotic, major depressive disorder.
Results
Internal consistency was high for the QIDS-SR16 (Cronbach’s α = .86), the IDS-SR30 (Cronbach’s α = .92), and the HAM-D24 (Cronbach’s α = .88). QIDS-SR16 total scores were highly correlated with IDS-SR30 (.96) and HAM-D24 (.86) total scores. Item–total correlations revealed that several similar items were highly correlated with both QIDS-SR16 and IDS-SR30 total scores. Roughly 1.3 times the QIDS-SR16 total score is predictive of the HAM-D17 (17-item version of the HAM-D) total score.
Conclusions
The QIDS-SR16 was as sensitive to symptom change as the IDS-SR30 and HAM-D24, indicating high concurrent validity for all three scales. The QIDS-SR16 has highly acceptable psychometric properties, which supports the usefulness of this brief rating of depressive symptom severity in both clinical and research settings.},

Instead, spectra with a broadband "1/f" shape were observed in both groups, and these spectra were significantly flatter in normal subjects (P=.02). Correlation dimension estimates are a measure of nonlinear deterministic structure, and convergent estimates could be obtained for six of the seven patients with bipolar disorder and none of the normal subjects (P\&lt;.001). Additional findings are consistent with these results. These studies indicate that mood in Patients with bipolar disorder is not truly cyclic for extended periods.

	abstract = {Article Abstract  Objective: The long-term course of bipolar disorder is typified by recurring mood episodes of opposite polarity as well as mixed states. Rapid-cycling bipolar disorder refers to the presence of at least 4 mood episodes in the previous 12 months that meet the criteria for manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode. The purpose of this study was to synthesize data regarding prevalence, clinical correlates, and familial/genetic aspects related to rapid cycling in bipolar disorder. Data Sources: We searched the MEDLINE database through September 7, 2013 for articles regarding rapid cycling in bipolar disorder. Searches were performed using the keywords rapid cycling or rapid-cycling. The search strategy was augmented through the inspection of reference lists of relevant review articles. Eligible articles included original studies in English on rapid-cycling bipolar patients according to the criteria defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Study Selection: This study followed the recommendations of the Preferred Items for Reporting of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. The initial search returned 2,715 articles; 2,594 were excluded for several reasons (not aligned with objectives, pertaining to bipolar disorder but not focusing on rapid cycling, case reports, and case series). The final review included 119 articles. Data Extraction: Two investigators (K.N.F. and D.D.) independently reviewed articles for eligibility. Final decisions regarding eligibility were made by consensus following the full-text review. Results: The literature suggests that rapid cycling affects a significant proportion of bipolar patients and is related to a longer course of illness, an earlier age at onset, and more illegal drug and alcohol abuse and increased suicidality. Year prevalence of rapid cycling among all bipolar patients ranges between 5\%-33.3\%, while lifetime prevalence ranges between 25.8\%-43\%. The etiology remains unclear, although a causal or triggering role for the use of antidepressants and hypothyroidism is implicated. Rapid cycling seems to represent a transitory phenomenon rather than a stable pattern that characterizes the individual patient and probably is related to a worse outcome. Conclusions: Rapid cycling is a frequent, although underrecognized, condition in bipolar disorder, and it constitutes a worsening of the primary disorder. There is no good evidence that rapid cycling represents a discrete subtype. Early recognition of this pattern can lead to better treatment strategy and improvement of the long-term course. Conceptualizing rapid cycling according to Research Domain Criteria will be an important advance.},

	abstract = {Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric condition characterized by episodes of elevated mood interspersed with episodes of depression. While treatment developments and understanding the disruptive nature of this illness have focused on these episodes, it is also evident that some patients may have chronic week-to-week mood instability. This is also a major morbidity. The longitudinal pattern of this mood instability is poorly understood as it has, until recently, been difficult to quantify. We propose that understanding this mood variability is critical for the development of cognitive neuroscience-based treatments. In this study, we develop a time-series approach to capture mood variability in two groups of patients with bipolar disorder who appear on the basis of clinical judgement to show relatively stable or unstable illness courses. Using weekly mood scores based on a self-rated scale (quick inventory of depressive symptomatology—self-rated; QIDS-SR) from 23 patients over a 220-week period, we show that the observed mood variability is nonlinear and that the stable and unstable patient groups are described by different nonlinear time-series processes. We emphasize the necessity in combining both appropriate measures of the underlying deterministic processes (the QIDS-SR score) and noise (uncharacterized temporal variation) in understanding dynamical patterns of mood variability associated with bipolar disorder.},

The remaining patients (at baseline or exit) were in either a manic or mixed phase and were pooled for statistical reasons.Results: Similar results were found for the QIDS-C16 and QIDS-SR16. Scores were reasonably reliable to the extent that variability within groups permitted. As expected, euthymic patients showed less depressive symptomatology than depressed patients. Sad mood and general interest were tne most discriminating symptoms between depressed and euthymic phases. Changes in illness phase (baseline to exit) were associated with substantial changes in scores. The relation of individual depressive symptoms to the overall level of depression was consistent across phases.Conclusion: Both the QIDS-SR16 and QIDS-C16 are suitable measures of depressive symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder.},

	abstract = {Background
Bipolar Disorder is characterized by episodes running the full mood spectrum, from mania to depression. Between mood episodes, residual symptoms remain, as sleep alterations, circadian cycle disturbances, emotional deregulation, cognitive impairment and increased risk for comorbidities. The present review intends to reflect about the most recent and relevant information concerning the biunivocal relation between bipolar disorder and circadian cycles.
Methods
It was conducted a literature search on PubMed database using the search terms “bipolar”, “circadian”, “melatonin”, “cortisol”, “body temperature”, “Clock gene”, “Bmal1 gene”, “Per gene”, “Cry gene”, “GSK3β”, “chronotype”, “light therapy”, “dark therapy”, “sleep deprivation”, “lithum” and “agomelatine”. Search results were manually reviewed, and pertinent studies were selected for inclusion as appropriate.
Results
Several studies support the relationship between bipolar disorder and circadian cycles, discussing alterations in melatonin, body temperature and cortisol rhythms; disruption of sleep/wake cycle; variations of clock genes; and chronotype. Some therapeutics for bipolar disorder directed to the circadian cycles disturbances are also discussed, including lithium carbonate, agomelatine, light therapy, dark therapy, sleep deprivation and interpersonal and social rhythm therapy.
Limitations
This review provides a summary of an extensive research for the relevant literature on this theme, not a patient-wise meta-analysis.
Conclusions
In the future, it is essential to achieve a better understanding of the relation between bipolar disorder and the circadian system. It is required to establish new treatment protocols, combining psychotherapy, therapies targeting the circadian rhythms and the latest drugs, in order to reduce the risk of relapse and improve affective behaviour.},

This new edition by two acknowledged experts on the subject offers an up-to-date account of practical methodology for handling missing data problems. Blending theory and application, authors Roderick Little and Donald Rubin review historical approaches to the subject and describe simple methods for multivariate analysis with missing values. They then provide a coherent theory for analysis of problems based on likelihoods derived from statistical models for the data and the missing data mechanism, and then they apply the theory to a wide range of important missing data problems.Statistical Analysis with Missing Data, Third Edition starts by introducing readers to the subject and approaches toward solving it. It looks at the patterns and mechanisms that create the missing data, as well as a taxonomy of missing data. It then goes on to examine missing data in experiments, before discussing complete-case and available-case analysis, including weighting methods. The new edition expands its coverage to include recent work on topics such as nonresponse in sample surveys, causal inference, diagnostic methods, and sensitivity analysis, among a host of other topics.  An updated “classic” written by renowned authorities on the subject Features over 150 exercises (including many new ones) Covers recent work on important methods like multiple imputation, robust alternatives to weighting, and Bayesian methods Revises previous topics based on past student feedback and class experience Contains an updated and expanded bibliography  The authors were awarded The Karl Pearson Prize in 2017 by the International Statistical Institute, for a research contribution that has had profound influence on statistical theory, methodology or applications. Their work "has been no less than defining and transforming." (ISI)Statistical Analysis with Missing Data, Third Edition is an ideal textbook for upper undergraduate and/or beginning graduate level students of the subject. It is also an excellent source of information for applied statisticians and practitioners in government and industry.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: High rates of misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis, and lack of recognition and treatment of comorbid conditions often lead patients with bipolar illness to have a chronic course with high disability, unemployment rates, and mortality. Despite the recognition that long-term outcome of bipolar disorder depends on systematic assessment of both interepisodic dysfunctional domains and comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions, treatment of bipolar disorder still focuses primarily on alleviation of acute symptoms and prevention of future recurrences. We propose here to review the evidence offering a modern view of bipolar disorder defined as a chronic and progressive multisystem disorder, taking into account characteristics of each patient as well as biosignatures in order to help design personalized treatments.
DATA SOURCES: We conducted a systematic PubMed search of all English-language articles, published between 2000 and 2010, focusing on the English and French literature with bipolar disorder cross-referenced with the following search terms: emotional dysregulation, sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances, cognitive impairment, age at onset, comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions, psychosocial and medical interventions, outcome, remission, and personalized medicine. The search was conducted between July 2009 and July 2010. The literature on bipolar disorder was reviewed to provide supporting evidence that the assessment of various symptom domains that are dysfunctional between episodes should all be considered as core dimensions of the disorder.
STUDY SELECTION: Forty-one articles were identified through the PubMed search described above and selected on the basis of addressing any combination of the search terms in conjunction with bipolar disorder.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Current guidelines advocate the use of more or less similar treatment algorithms for all patients, ignoring the clinical, pathophysiological, and lifetime heterogeneity of bipolar disorder. Systematic assessment of interepisodic dimensions, along with comorbid medical and psychiatric risk factors, should be performed along the life cycle in order to plan specific and personalized pharmacologic, medical, and psychosocial interventions tailored to the needs of each patient and ready-to-test biosignatures to serve as risk factors or diagnostic or prognostic tools.
CONCLUSIONS: Medical and research findings, along with health economic data, support a more modern view of bipolar disorder as a chronic, progressive, multisystem disorder. This new comprehensive framework should guide the search to identify biomarkers and etiologic factors and should help design a new policy for health care, including prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and training.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rapid-cycling bipolar disorder is defined as four or more affective episodes yearly. The conventionally recognised limit in episode duration is usually considered 24 hours (i.e. a cycle duration of 48 hours). We report a small series of intensively observed bipolar patients who showed much faster patterns of mood oscillation.
METHODS: Detailed, systematic, longitudinal assessment of five bipolar patients during extended in-patient psychiatric evaluation were conducted, including retrospective life charting and prospective evaluation of daily mood by self and blinded observer ratings, and motor activity recording.
RESULTS: Our data demonstrate a spectrum of cycling frequencies in rapid-cyclers, including distinct, clinically robust mood shifts that occur at frequencies faster than once per 24 hours. Affective oscillations spanned a range of cycling frequencies from four episodes per year (rapid cycling) to those occurring within the course of weeks to several days (ultra-rapid cycling), to distinct, abrupt mood shifts of less than 24 hours duration (ultra-ultra rapid or ultradian cycling). The time of onset and duration of these ultradian affective fluctuations are highly variable and they are observed in bipolar patients without evidence of personality disorder.
CONCLUSIONS: The potential clinical and theoretical implications of these first systematic observations of ultra-rapid and ultradian cycling in the context of the evolution of otherwise classical bipolar affective illness are discussed.},

First, the discovery of risk genes and their implications, with a focus on voltage-gated calcium channels as part of the disease process and as a drug target. Second, facilitated by new technologies, it is increasingly apparent that the bipolar phenotype is more complex and nuanced than simply one of recurring manic and depressive episodes. One such feature is persistent mood instability, and efforts are underway to understand its mechanisms and its therapeutic potential. BD illustrates how psychiatry is being transformed by contemporary neuroscience, genomics, and digital approaches., BD is highly heritable and mostly attributable to common variants of small effect. Several risk genes and gene networks have been identified., Calcium signalling is prominent among the genetic risk pathways, and currently appears to have the greatest therapeutic traction., Digital technologies and sophisticated mathematical and computational analyses are being used to quantify and understand BD., These new methods reflect, and are promoting, reconceptualisation of BD as a chronic instability of mood and neural circuitry., Stem cells are becoming an integral part of the approaches to understanding BD and its pharmacotherapy., New experimental medicine models are being applied to identify and rapidly test potential mood-stabilising treatments.},

We apply a state-of-the-art group detection algorithm to annotate such location traces with group vs. individual context, and then show that individuals vs. groups exhibit significant differences along three behavioural traits: (1) the mobility pattern, (2) the responsiveness to calls / SMSs and (3) application usage. We show that these significant differences are robust to underlying errors in the group detection technique and that the use of such group context leads to behavioural results that differ from those reported in prior popular work.},

Patterns of such touch interactions on a keyboard may reflect emotions of a user. Since users may switch between different touch modalities while using a keyboard, therefore, automatic detection of emotion from touch patterns must consider both modalities in combination to detect the pattern. In this paper, we focus on identifying different features of touch interactions with a smartphone keyboard that lead to a personalized model for inferring user emotion. Since distinguishing typing and swyping activity is important to record the correct features, we designed a technique to correctly identify the modality. The ground truth labels for user emotion are collected directly from the user by periodically collecting self-reports. We jointly model typing and swyping features and correlate them with user provided self-reports to build a personalized machine learning model, which detects four emotion states (happy, sad, stressed, relaxed). We combine these design choices into an Android application TouchSense and evaluate the same in a 3-week in-the-wild study involving 22 participants. Our key evaluation results and post-study participant assessment demonstrate that it is possible to predict these emotion states with an average accuracy (AUCROC) of 73\% (std dev. 6\%, maximum 87\%) combining these two touch interactions only.},

Among these techniques, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been extensively applied. We then presented the key concepts of HMMs and the main problems during their application. Using neural data recorded from three distinct sectors in the monkey parietal cortex during an arm movement task, we show how HMMs can be used both to define neural dynamics and the flow of information at the network level, but also to decode relevant task parameters from neural activity in order to control finite state brain–machine interfaces (BMIs). We found that the HMM state transitions were in accordance with a functional gradient in the parietal cortex and that they carry reliable information about target position and behavioural phases. Finally, we provide a brief review of the literature on HMMs in the field and an overview of other approaches that can model time series.},

	abstract = {State modeling of whole-brain electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) allows to investigate transient, recurring neurodynamical events. Two widely-used techniques are the microstate analysis of EEG signals and hidden Markov modeling (HMM) of MEG power envelopes. Both reportedly lead to similar state lifetimes on the 100 ms timescale, suggesting a common neural basis. To investigate whether microstates and power envelope HMM states describe the same neural dynamics, we used simultaneous MEG/EEG recordings at rest and compared the spatial signature and temporal activation dynamics of microstates and power envelope HMM states obtained separately from EEG and MEG. Results showed that microstates and power envelope HMM states differ both spatially and temporally. Microstates reflect sharp events of neural synchronization, whereas power envelope HMM states disclose network-level activity with 100–200 ms lifetimes. Further, MEG microstates do not correspond to the canonical EEG microstates but are better interpreted as split HMM states. On the other hand, both MEG and EEG HMM states involve the (de)activation of similar functional networks. Microstate analysis and power envelope HMM thus appear sensitive to neural events occurring over different spatial and temporal scales. As such, they represent complementary approaches to explore the fast, sub-second scale bursting electrophysiological dynamics in spontaneous human brain activity.},

We show that the magnitude of correlations, their attentional modulation, and dependence on lateral distance are explained by columnar On-Off dynamics, which are synchronous activity fluctuations reflecting cortical state. We developed a network model in which the On-Off dynamics propagate across nearby columns generating spatial correlations with the extent controlled by attentional inputs. This mechanism, unlike previous proposals, predicts spatially non-uniform changes in correlations during attention. We confirm this prediction in our columnar recordings by showing that in superficial layers the largest changes in correlations occur at intermediate lateral distances. Our results reveal how spatially structured patterns of correlated variability emerge through interactions of cortical state dynamics, anatomical connectivity, and attention.},

	abstract = {During wakefulness, cortical networks exhibit diverse states of activity arising from fluctuations in modulatory inputs, any of which may shape the recorded neural activity across a range of scales, from local field potential (LFP) to the spiking of individual neurons. Multiple studies have uncovered state-dependent changes in single neuron activity specific to cell type. These changes are heterogeneous across cell types, suggesting that there is a link between changes in states of wakefulness and the dynamic patterns of spiking activity across the population, yet this is currently not well understood. Here, we use an unsupervised statistical modeling framework to link fluctuations in the state of the LFP to the dynamics of spiking activity of populations of neurons in the whisker area of primary somatosensory cortex of awake male mice. By identifying latent states from population spiking activity, we show that these spiking states are more informative of states of the LFP than a direct readout of the spiking activity of single neurons or of the population. Further, we find that the latent spiking states predict trial-by-trial variability in sensory responses as well as one aspect of behavior, whisking activity. Taken together, our approach captures the latent variables that underlie the dynamics of the spiking activity of cortical neuronal populations, providing a framework to relate cortical activity across different scales.
Significance statement During wakefulness, variability in cortical activity can arise from shifts in arousal or behavior. We analyze the dynamics of two measures of cortical activity, the spiking activity of local populations of neurons and the local field potential (LFP), typically used to track overall levels of arousal. We show that the latent states that capture variability in population spiking activity are highly predictive of LFP state changes, even more so than spiking activity directly. By linking latent states of spiking activity to changes in the LFP, our novel approach bridges fine-scale microcircuits ensemble activity and the meso-scale LFP. Our latent-state framework opens new avenues for extracting information from the LFP as well as identification of subject-level sources of variability.},

	abstract = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) that include individual-level random effects have recently been promoted for inferring animal movement behaviour from biotelemetry data. These ‘mixed HMMs’ come at significant cost in terms of implementation and computation, and discrete random effects have been advocated as a practical alternative to more computationally intensive continuous random effects. However, the performance of mixed HMMs has not yet been sufficiently explored to justify their widespread adoption, and there is currently little guidance for practitioners weighing the costs and benefits of mixed HMMs for a particular research objective. I performed an extensive simulation study comparing the performance of a suite of fixed and random effect models for individual heterogeneity in the hidden state process of a two-state HMM. I focused on sampling scenarios more typical of telemetry studies, which often consist of relatively long time series (30–250 observations per animal) for relatively few individuals (5–100 animals). I generally found mixed HMMs did not improve state assignment relative to standard HMMs. Reliable estimation of random effects required larger sample sizes than are often feasible in telemetry studies. Continuous random effect models performed reasonably well with data generated under discrete random effects, but not vice versa. Random effects accounting for unexplained individual variation can improve estimation of state transition probabilities and measurable covariate effects, but discrete random effects can be a relatively poor (and potentially misleading) approximation for continuous variation. When weighing the costs and benefits of mixed HMMs, three important considerations are study objectives, sample size and model complexity. HMM applications often focus on state assignment with little emphasis on heterogeneity in state transition probabilities, in which case random effects in the hidden state process simply may not be worth the additional effort. However, if explaining variation in state transition probabilities is a primary objective and sufficient explanatory covariates are not available, then random effects are worth pursuing as a more parsimonious alternative to individual fixed effects. To help put my findings in context and illustrate some potential challenges that practitioners may encounter when applying mixed HMMs, I revisit a previous analysis of long-finned pilot whale biotelemetry data.},

	abstract = {As online platforms are striving to get more users, a critical challenge is user churn, which is especially concerning for new users. In this paper, by taking the anonymous large-scale real-world data from Snapchat as an example, we develop {\textbackslash}textit\{ClusChurn\}, a systematic two-step framework for interpretable new user clustering and churn prediction, based on the intuition that proper user clustering can help understand and predict user churn. Therefore, {\textbackslash}textit\{ClusChurn\} firstly groups new users into interpretable typical clusters, based on their activities on the platform and ego-network structures. Then we design a novel deep learning pipeline based on LSTM and attention to accurately predict user churn with very limited initial behavior data, by leveraging the correlations among users' multi-dimensional activities and the underlying user types. {\textbackslash}textit\{ClusChurn\} is also able to predict user types, which enables rapid reactions to different types of user churn. Extensive data analysis and experiments show that {\textbackslash}textit\{ClusChurn\} provides valuable insight into user behaviors, and achieves state-of-the-art churn prediction performance. The whole framework is deployed as a data analysis pipeline, delivering real-time data analysis and prediction results to multiple relevant teams for business intelligence uses. It is also general enough to be readily adopted by any online systems with user behavior data.},

	abstract = {While mobile social apps have become increasingly important in people's daily life, we have limited understanding on what motivates users to engage with these apps. In this paper, we answer the question whether users' in-app activity patterns help inform their future app engagement (e.g., active days in a future time window)? Previous studies on predicting user app engagement mainly focus on various macroscopic features (e.g., time-series of activity frequency), while ignoring fine-grained inter-dependencies between different in-app actions at the microscopic level. Here we propose to formalize individual user's in-app action transition patterns as a temporally evolving action graph, and analyze its characteristics in terms of informing future user engagement. Our analysis suggested that action graphs are able to characterize user behavior patterns and inform future engagement. We derive a number of high-order graph features to capture in-app usage patterns and construct interpretable models for predicting trends of engagement changes and active rates. To further enhance predictive power, we design an end-to-end, multi-channel neural model to encode temporal action graphs, activity sequences, and other macroscopic features. Experiments on predicting user engagement for 150k Snapchat new users over a 28-day period demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models. The prediction framework is deployed at Snapchat to deliver real world business insights. Our proposed framework is also general and can be applied to other social app platforms.},

These are all methods for summarizing observed variables by postulating an underlying categorical latent variable representing a type or status; in the case of LTA, the status of an individual may change over time and the pathways of change are of interest. As the introductory article by Hickendorff, Edelsbrunner, McMullen, Schneider, and Trezise points out, these methods are useful when theory suggests that a learning or problem-solving process can occur in distinct modes or phases. They can also be useful when it is desirable to give qualitative descriptions of individuals' approaches to a task based on their responses across several variables rather than just simple numerical scores. The articles in this special issue use latent variable mixture models in creative and insightful ways, demonstrating their versatility and practicality. However, some challenges remain for researchers using these methods. A number of exciting future directions remain for quantitative methodologists and applied researchers to work together to address new questions in learning and individual differences research. Latent variable mixture modeling will continue to be a powerful tool learning researchers can use to address the critical, sophisticated, theoretically based research questions facing the field.},

The results revealed that larger samples are required when the latent classes are less distinct and more complex with fewer indicators.

	abstract = {The use of multilevel VAR(1) models to unravel within-individual process dynamics is gaining momentum in psychological research. These models accommodate the structure of intensive longitudinal datasets in which repeated measurements are nested within individuals. They estimate within-individual auto- and cross-regressive relationships while incorporating and using information about the distributions of these effects across individuals. An important quality feature of the obtained estimates pertains to how well they generalize to unseen data. Bulteel and colleagues (Psychol Methods 23(4):740–756, 2018a) showed that this feature can be assessed through a cross-validation approach, yielding a predictive accuracy measure. In this article, we follow up on their results, by performing three simulation studies that allow to systematically study five factors that likely affect the predictive accuracy of multilevel VAR(1) models: (i) the number of measurement occasions per person, (ii) the number of persons, (iii) the number of variables, (iv) the contemporaneous collinearity between the variables, and (v) the distributional shape of the individual differences in the VAR(1) parameters (i.e., normal versus multimodal distributions). Simulation results show that pooling information across individuals and using multilevel techniques prevent overfitting. Also, we show that when variables are expected to show strong contemporaneous correlations, performing multilevel VAR(1) in a reduced variable space can be useful. Furthermore, results reveal that multilevel VAR(1) models with random effects have a better predictive performance than person-specific VAR(1) models when the sample includes groups of individuals that share similar dynamics.},

Dynamic structural equation modeling (DSEM) is one such methodology but recent studies have suggested that its small N performance is poor. This is problematic because small N data are omnipresent in empirical applications due to logistical and financial concerns associated with gathering many measurements on many people. In this paper, we discuss how previous studies considering small samples have focused on Bayesian methods with diffuse priors. The small sample literature has shown that diffuse priors may cause problems because they become unintentionally informative. Instead, we outline how researchers can create weakly informative admissible-range-restricted priors, even in the absence of previous studies. A simulation study shows that metrics like relative bias and non-null detection rates with these admissible-range-restricted priors improve small N properties of DSEM compared to diffuse priors.},

By allowing random intercept variation in the model, between-subject variation is separated from the within-subject latent class transitions over time allowing a clearer interpretation of the data. Analysis of two examples from the literature demonstrates the advantages of random intercept LTA. Model variations include Mover-Stayer analysis, measurement invariance analysis, and analysis with covariates.},

	abstract = {Latent transition analysis (LTA), also referred to as latent Markov modeling, is an extension of latent class/profile analysis (LCA/LPA) used to model the interrelations of multiple latent class variables. LTA methods have become increasingly accessible and in-turn are being utilized in applied research. The current article provides an introduction to LTA by answering 10 questions commonly asked by applied researchers. Topics discussed include: (1) an overview of LTA; (2) a comparison of LTA to other longitudinal models; (3) software used to run LTA; (4) sample size suggestions; (5) modeling steps in LTA; (6) measurement invariance; (7) the inclusion of auxiliary variables; (8) interpreting results of an LTA; (9) the nature of data (e.g., longitudinal, cross-sectional); and (10) extensions of LTA. An applied example of LTA is included to help understand how to build an LTA and interpret results. Finally, the article suggests future areas of research for LTA. This article provides an overview of LTA, highlighting key decisions researchers need to make to navigate and implement an LTA analysis from start to finish.

Latent Transition Analysis is an alternative procedure that is applicable to categorical latent variable models such as stage models. The method involves four different types of parameters, each of which may be relevant to different research questions. Two examples that employ the Stages of Change construct are used to illustrate the method. In the first example, three different models of longitudinal change are compared. In the second example, the effects of an expert system intervention for smoking is compared to a control condition. The method permits the investigation of a series of specific comparisons: (1) the effectiveness of the intervention for individuals in different stages can be assessed; (2) the effectiveness of the intervention can be evaluated for different time intervals; and (3) the effects of intervention on both progression through the stages and regression through the stages or relapse can be assessed. Other potential applications of the method are also discussed.},

Four profiles of 14-day substance use behavior were identified: (1) Non-Users; (2) Cigarette Smokers; (3) Binge Drinkers; and (4) Bingers with Marijuana Use. The most prevalent behavior profile at both times was the Non-Users (with over half of the students having this profile), followed by Binge Drinkers and Bingers with Marijuana Use. Cigarette Smokers was the least prevalent behavior profile.

However, unusual features in the likelihood can cause difficulties in ML and Bayesian inference and estimation, especially with small samples. In this study we explore several problems in drawing inference for LTA in the context of a simulation study and a substance use example. We argue that when conventional ML and Bayesian estimates behave erratically, problems often may be alleviated with a small amount of prior input for LTA with small samples. This paper proposes a dynamic data-dependent prior for LTA with small samples and compares the performance of the estimation methods with the proposed prior in drawing inference.

Hidden semi-Markov chains are particularly useful to model the succession of homogeneous zones or segments along sequences. A discrete hidden semi-Markov chain is composed of a nonobservable state process, which is a semi-Markov chain, and a discrete output process. Hidden semi-Markov chains generalize hidden Markov chains and enable the modeling of various durational structures. From an algorithmic point of view, a new forward-backward algorithm is proposed whose complexity is similar to that of the Viterbi algorithm in terms of sequence length (quadratic in the worst case in time and linear in space). This opens the way to the maximum likelihood estimation of hidden semi-Markov chains from long sequences. This statistical modeling approach is illustrated by the analysis of branching and flowering patterns in plants.},

For each individual a latent class variable is measured at each time point and the latent class changes across time follow a Markov process (i.e., a hidden or latent Markov model), with subject-specific transition probabilities that are estimated as random effects. Such a model for single-subject data has been referred to as the regime-switching state-space model. The latent class variable can be measured by continuous or categorical indicators, under the local independence condition, or more generally by a class-specific structural equation model or a dynamic structural equation model. We discuss the Bayesian estimation based on Markov chain Monto Carlo, which allows modeling with arbitrary long time series data and many random effects.

Given the increasing popularity of LCA, our aim is to equip psychological researchers with the theoretical and statistical fundamentals that we believe will facilitate the application of LCA models in practice. In this article, we provide answers to 10 frequently asked questions about LCA. The questions included in this article were fielded from our experience consulting with applied researchers interested in using LCA. The major topics include a general introduction in the LCA; an overview of class enumeration (e.g., deciding on the number of classes), including commonly used statistical fit indices; substantive interpretation of LCA solutions; estimation of covariates and distal outcome relations to the latent class variable; data requirements for LCA; software choices and considerations; distinctions and similarities among LCA and related latent variable models; and extensions of the LCA model. To illustrate the modeling ideas described in this article, we present an applied example using LCA. Specifically, we use LCA to model individual differences in positive youth development among college students and analyze demographic characteristics as covariates and a distal outcome of overall life satisfaction. We also include key references that direct readers to more detailed and technical discussions of these topics for which we provide an applied and introductory overview. We conclude by mentioning future developments in research and practice, including advanced cross-sectional and longitudinal extensions of LCA.

The results suggested that in general, a larger sample size, more indicators, a higher quality of indicators, and a larger covariate effect lead to more converged and proper replications, as well as fewer boundary parameter estimates and less parameter bias. Furthermore, interactions among these study factors demonstrated how using more or higher quality indicators, as well as larger covariate effect size, could sometimes compensate for small sample size. Including a covariate appeared to be generally beneficial, although the covariate parameters themselves showed relatively large bias. Our results provide useful information for practitioners designing an LCA study in terms of highlighting the factors that lead to better or worse performance of LCA.},

The objectives of this study were to investigate the impact of bipolar disorder on the lives of people diagnosed with this disorder. The method used was a general inductive qualitative approach. Twenty-one participants were interviewed between 2008 and 2009 about how they had experienced the impact of bipolar disorder. The interviews were audio-taped and transcribed. The core theme that emerged was the participants were feeling out of control. Their own reactions and the reactions of others to the symptoms of bipolar disorder contributed to this core theme. The core theme was constituted by feeling overwhelmed, a loss of autonomy and felling flawed. Mental health nurses can help facilitate a sense of personal control for people with bipolar disorder by exploring what the symptoms mean for that person and implementing strategies to manage the symptoms, address social stigma and facilitate active involvement in treatment.},

	abstract = {Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric condition characterized by episodes of elevated mood interspersed with episodes of depression. While treatment developments and understanding the disruptive nature of this illness have focused on these episodes, it is also evident that some patients may have chronic week-to-week mood instability. This is also a major morbidity. The longitudinal pattern of this mood instability is poorly understood as it has, until recently, been difficult to quantify. We propose that understanding this mood variability is critical for the development of cognitive neuroscience-based treatments. In this study, we develop a time-series approach to capture mood variability in two groups of patients with bipolar disorder who appear on the basis of clinical judgement to show relatively stable or unstable illness courses. Using weekly mood scores based on a self-rated scale (quick inventory of depressive symptomatology-self-rated; QIDS-SR) from 23 patients over a 220-week period, we show that the observed mood variability is nonlinear and that the stable and unstable patient groups are described by different nonlinear time-series processes. We emphasize the necessity in combining both appropriate measures of the underlying deterministic processes (the QIDS-SR score) and noise (uncharacterized temporal variation) in understanding dynamical patterns of mood variability associated with bipolar disorder.},

	abstract = {Objectives Although cannabis use is common in bipolar disorder and may contribute to worse clinical outcomes, little is understood about the relationship between this drug and bipolar disorder over the course of daily life. The aim of study was to examine the effect of cannabis on affect and bipolar symptoms in a group of individuals with bipolar disorder. Methods Twenty-four participants with bipolar disorder type I or type II completed diaries for 6 days using Experience Sampling Methodology to investigate the temporal associations between cannabis, affect and bipolar disorder symptoms. Results The results indicated that higher levels of positive affect increase the odds of using cannabis (OR:1.25 ,CI:1.06–1.47, P=0.008). However, neither negative affect, manic nor depressive symptoms predicted the use of cannabis. Cannabis use was associated with subsequent increases in positive affect (β=0.35, CI:0.20-0.51, P=0.000), manic symptoms (β=0.20,CI:0.05-0.34, P=0.009) and depressive symptoms (β= 0.17,CI:0.04-0.29, P=0.008). Conclusion The findings indicate that cannabis use is associated with a number of subsequent psychological effects. However there was no evidence that individuals with BD were using cannabis to self-medicate minor fluctuations in negative affect or bipolar disorder symptoms over the course of daily life. The findings in relation to existing literature and clinical implications are discussed.},

Its main objective is to create an empirically based representation of mental strengths and vulnerabilities, accounting for (i) dimensionality and heterogeneity, (ii) interactivity between symptoms and strengths, and (iii) intra‐individual variability. To do so, HowNutsAreTheDutch (HND) makes use of an internet platform that allows participants to (a) compare themselves to other participants via cross‐sectional questionnaires and (b) to monitor themselves three times a day for 30 days with an intensive longitudinal diary study via their smartphone. These data enable for personalized feedback to participants, a study of profiles of mental strengths and weaknesses, and zooming into the fine‐grained level of dynamic relationships between variables over time. Measuring both psychiatric symptomatology and mental strengths and resources enables for an investigation of their interactions, which may underlie the wide variety of observed mental states in the population.

First the vulnerability to develop mood disorders is studied by looking at chronotype (being a morning or evening person), genes and mood disorders. There were a number of genes related to mood disorders and to chronotype, but there was no mediating effect. Furthermore, we showed that patients with depressive disorder did not have more social jetlag (the mismatch between internal clock and external rhythm).The second part studied the direct relationship in rest-activity rhythms and bipolar disorder. We found patients with bipolar disorder are able to maintain a normal rest-activity rhythm outside a mood episode. Furthermore, we showed that sleep disturbances might function as a warning sign for an imminent mood episode. In a detailed study we found that especially in a manic episode sleep disturbances precede the mood episode. Lastly we studied a novel biomarker in activity patterns, which might be able to help diagnose bipolar disorder.In the third part we showed patients with seasonal affective disorder can be successfully treated with light therapy in the morning. Only one week of light therapy might be enough and there is no need for individual timing of the light on what chronotype the patient is.},

Affect and sleep, academic, and social behavior showed substantial changes from school semesters to school breaks and from weekdays to weekends. Three student clusters were identified with behavioral and affective dissociations and varying levels of distress throughout the year. While academics were a common stressor for all, the cluster with highest distress stood out by frequent report of social stress. Moreover, the frequency of reporting social, but not academic, stress predicted subsequent clinical symptoms. Two years later, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the first-year cluster with highest distress again stood out by frequent social stress and elevated clinical symptoms.

When information on the classes of the observations is available in advanced, supervised methods can be applied. In this paper, we provide details for the implementation of four models for classification in a supervised learning context: HMMs, hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs), autoregressive-HMMs, and autoregressive-HSMMs. Using simulations, we study the classification performance under various degrees of model misspecification to characterize when it would be important to extend a basic HMM to an HSMM. As an application of these techniques we use the models to classify accelerometer data from Merino sheep to distinguish between four different behaviors of interest. In particular in the field of movement ecology, collection of fine-scale animal movement data over time to identify behavioral states has become ubiquitous, necessitating models that can account for the dependence structure in the data. We demonstrate that when the aim is to conduct classification, various degrees of model misspecification of the proposed model may not impede good classification performance unless there is high overlap between the state-dependent distributions, that is, unless the observation distributions of the different states are difficult to differentiate.

	abstract = {Background
Mental health disorders affect multiple aspects of patients’ lives, including mood, cognition, and behavior. eHealth and mobile health (mHealth) technologies enable rich sets of information to be collected noninvasively, representing a promising opportunity to construct behavioral markers of mental health. Combining such data with self-reported information about psychological symptoms may provide a more comprehensive and contextualized view of a patient’s mental state than questionnaire data alone. However, mobile sensed data are usually noisy and incomplete, with significant amounts of missing observations. Therefore, recognizing the clinical potential of mHealth tools depends critically on developing methods to cope with such data issues.

Objective
This study aims to present a machine learning–based approach for emotional state prediction that uses passively collected data from mobile phones and wearable devices and self-reported emotions. The proposed methods must cope with high-dimensional and heterogeneous time-series data with a large percentage of missing observations.

Methods
Passively sensed behavior and self-reported emotional state data from a cohort of 943 individuals (outpatients recruited from community clinics) were available for analysis. All patients had at least 30 days’ worth of naturally occurring behavior observations, including information about physical activity, geolocation, sleep, and smartphone app use. These regularly sampled but frequently missing and heterogeneous time series were analyzed with the following probabilistic latent variable models for data averaging and feature extraction: mixture model (MM) and hidden Markov model (HMM). The extracted features were then combined with a classifier to predict emotional state. A variety of classical machine learning methods and recurrent neural networks were compared. Finally, a personalized Bayesian model was proposed to improve performance by considering the individual differences in the data and applying a different classifier bias term for each patient.

Results
Probabilistic generative models proved to be good preprocessing and feature extractor tools for data with large percentages of missing observations. Models that took into account the posterior probabilities of the MM and HMM latent states outperformed those that did not by more than 20\%, suggesting that the underlying behavioral patterns identified were meaningful for individuals’ overall emotional state. The best performing generalized models achieved a 0.81 area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic and 0.71 area under the precision-recall curve when predicting self-reported emotional valence from behavior in held-out test data. Moreover, the proposed personalized models demonstrated that accounting for individual differences through a simple hierarchical model can substantially improve emotional state prediction performance without relying on previous days’ data.

Conclusions
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of designing machine learning models for predicting emotional states from mobile sensing data capable of dealing with heterogeneous data with large numbers of missing observations. Such models may represent valuable tools for clinicians to monitor patients’ mood states.},

While both kinematic and dynamic elements have been proposed to compose complex actions, the structure of movement decomposition and its neural representation remain unknown. Here, we examined movement decomposition by modeling the temporal dynamics of neural populations in the primary motor cortex of macaque monkeys performing forelimb reaching movements. Using a hidden Markov model, we found that global transitions in the neural population activity are associated with a consistent segmentation of the behavioral output into acceleration and deceleration epochs with directional selectivity. Single cells exhibited modulation of firing rates between the kinematic epochs, with abrupt changes in spiking activity timed with the identified transitions. These results reveal distinct encoding of acceleration and deceleration phases at the level of M1, and point to a specific pattern of movement decomposition that arises from the underlying neural activity. A similar approach can be used to probe the structure of movement decomposition in different brain regions, possibly controlling different temporal scales, to reveal the hierarchical structure of movement composition.},

	abstract = {Checking that models adequately represent data is an essential component of applied statistical inference. Ecologists increasingly use hierarchical Bayesian statistical models in their research. The appeal of this modeling paradigm is undeniable, as researchers can build and fit models that embody complex ecological processes while simultaneously accounting for observation error. However, ecologists tend to be less focused on checking model assumptions and assessing potential lack of fit when applying Bayesian methods than when applying more traditional modes of inference such as maximum likelihood. There are also multiple ways of assessing the fit of Bayesian models, each of which has strengths and weaknesses. For instance, Bayesian P values are relatively easy to compute, but are well known to be conservative, producing P values biased toward 0.5. Alternatively, lesser known approaches to model checking, such as prior predictive checks, cross-validation probability integral transforms, and pivot discrepancy measures may produce more accurate characterizations of goodness-of-fit but are not as well known to ecologists. In addition, a suite of visual and targeted diagnostics can be used to examine violations of different model assumptions and lack of fit at different levels of the modeling hierarchy, and to check for residual temporal or spatial autocorrelation. In this review, we synthesize existing literature to guide ecologists through the many available options for Bayesian model checking. We illustrate methods and procedures with several ecological case studies including (1) analysis of simulated spatiotemporal count data, (2) N-mixture models for estimating abundance of sea otters from an aircraft, and (3) hidden Markov modeling to describe attendance patterns of California sea lion mothers on a rookery. We find that commonly used procedures based on posterior predictive P values detect extreme model inadequacy, but often do not detect more subtle cases of lack of fit. Tests based on cross-validation and pivot discrepancy measures (including the “sampled predictive P value”) appear to be better suited to model checking and to have better overall statistical performance. We conclude that model checking is necessary to ensure that scientific inference is well founded. As an essential component of scientific discovery, it should accompany most Bayesian analyses presented in the literature.},

	abstract = {Neural populations, rather than single neurons, may be the fundamental unit of cortical computation. Analyzing chronically recorded neural population activity is challenging not only because of the high dimensionality of activity in many neurons, but also because of changes in the recorded signal that may or may not be due to neural plasticity. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are a promising technique for analyzing such data in terms of discrete, latent states, but previous approaches have either not considered the statistical properties of neural spiking data, have not been adaptable to longitudinal data, or have not modeled condition specific differences. We present a multilevel Bayesian HMM which addresses these shortcomings by incorporating multivariate Poisson log-normal emission probability distributions, multilevel parameter estimation, and trial-specific condition covariates. We applied this framework to multi-unit neural spiking data recorded using chronically implanted multi-electrode arrays from macaque primary motor cortex during a cued reaching, grasping, and placing task. We show that the model identifies latent neural population states which are tightly linked to behavioral events, despite the model being trained without any information about event timing. We show that these events represent specific spatiotemporal patterns of neural population activity and that their relationship to behavior is consistent over days of recording. The utility and stability of this approach is demonstrated using a previously learned task, but this multilevel Bayesian HMM framework would be especially suited for future studies of long-term plasticity in neural populations.},

The new edition is a revision of the book Applied Bayesian Hierarchical Methods. It maintains a focus on applied modelling and data analysis, but now using entirely R-based Bayesian computing options. It has been updated with a new chapter on regression for causal effects, and one on computing options and strategies. This latter chapter is particularly important, due to recent advances in Bayesian computing and estimation, including the development of rjags and rstan. It also features updates throughout with new examples.

The examples exploit and illustrate the broader advantages of the R computing environment, while allowing readers to explore alternative likelihood assumptions, regression structures, and assumptions on prior densities.

Features:


Provides a comprehensive and accessible overview of applied Bayesian hierarchical modelling


Includes many real data examples to illustrate different modelling topics


R code (based on rjags, jagsUI, R2OpenBUGS, and rstan) is integrated into the book, emphasizing implementation


Software options and coding principles are introduced in new chapter on computing

Previously, such predictions were based upon hidden Markov models (HMMs) due to their ability of modeling latent shopping phases with different user intents. In this work, we develop a duration-dependent hidden Markov model. In contrast to traditional HMMs, it explicitly models the duration of latent states and thereby allows states to become "sticky". The proposed model is superior to prior HMMs in detecting user exits: out of 100 user exits without purchase, it correctly identifies an additional 18. This helps marketers in better managing the online behavior of e-commerce customers. The reason for the superior performance of our model is the duration dependence, which allows our model to recover latent states that are characterized by a distorted sense of time. We finally provide a theoretical explanation for this, which builds upon the concept of "flow".},

In this article, we interpret the typical RNNs, including original RNN, standard long short-term memory (LSTM), peephole LSTM, projected LSTM, and gated recurrent unit (GRU), using a slightly extended hidden Markov model (HMM). Based on this interpretation, we are motivated to propose a novel RNN, called explicit duration recurrent network (EDRN), analog to a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM). It has a better performance than conventional LSTMs and can explicitly model any duration distribution function of the hidden state. The model parameters become interpretable and can be used to infer many other quantities that the conventional RNNs cannot obtain. Therefore, EDRN is expected to extend and enrich the applications of RNNs. The interpretation also suggests that the conventional RNNs, including LSTM and GRU, can be made small modifications to improve their performance without increasing the parameters of the networks.},

While the (shifted) Poisson and negative binomial distribution provide natural choices for such distributions, in practice, parametric distributions can lack the flexibility to adequately model the dwell times. To overcome this problem, a penalised maximum likelihood approach is proposed that allows for a flexible and data-driven estimation of the dwell-time distributions without the need to make any distributional assumption. This approach is suitable for direct modelling purposes or as an exploratory tool to investigate the latent state dynamics. The feasibility and potential of the suggested approach is illustrated in a simulation study and by modelling muskox movements in northeast Greenland using GPS tracking data. The proposed method is implemented in the R-package PHSMM which is available on CRAN.},

HSMMs are typically used less frequently than their basic HMM counterpart due to the increased computational challenges when evaluating the likelihood function. Moreover, while both models are sequential in nature, parameter estimation is mainly conducted via batch estimation methods. Thus, a major motivation of this paper is to provide methods to estimate HSMMs (1) in a computationally feasible time, (2) in an exact manner, i.e. only subject to Monte Carlo error, and (3) in a sequential setting. We provide and verify an efficient computational scheme for Bayesian parameter estimation on HSMMs. Additionally, we explore the performance of HSMMs on the VIX time series using Autoregressive (AR) models with hidden semi-Markov states and demonstrate how this algorithm can be used for regime switching, model selection and clustering purposes.},

However, one potential limitation of such models lies in their inability to explicitly structure the holding times of each hidden state. Hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs) are more useful in the latter respect as they incorporate additional temporal structure by explicit modelling of the holding times. However, HSMMs have generally received less attention in the literature, mainly due to their intensive computational requirements. Here a Bayesian implementation of HSMMs is presented. Recursive algorithms are proposed in conjunction with Metropolis-Hastings in such a way as to avoid sampling from the distribution of the hidden state sequence in the MCMC sampler. This provides a computationally tractable estimation framework for HSMMs avoiding the limitations associated with the conventional EM algorithm regarding model flexibility. Performance of the proposed implementation is demonstrated through simulation experiments as well as an illustrative application relating to recurrent failures in a network of underground water pipes where random effects are also included into the HSMM to allow for pipe heterogeneity.},

Previous work has primarily focused on continuous outcomes and little attention has been paid to count outcomes. The estimation of count outcome models can be difficult because the likelihood has no closed-form solution, meaning that approximation methods are required. Although adaptive Gaussian quadrature (AGQ) is generally seen as the gold standard, its comparative performance has been investigated with larger samples. AGQ approximates the full likelihood, a function that is known to produce biased estimates with small samples with continuous outcomes. Conversely, penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) is considered to be a less desirable approximation; however, it can approximate the restricted likelihood function, a function that is known to perform well with smaller samples with continuous outcomes. The goal of this paper is to compare the small sample bias of full likelihood methods to the linearization bias of PQL with restricted likelihood. Simulation results indicate that the linearization bias of PQL is preferable to the finite sample bias of AGQ with smaller samples.},

How does the cortex achieve this stable control? Using the sensorimotor system as a model of cortical processing, we investigated the hypothesis that the dynamics of neural latent activity, which captures the dominant co-variation patterns within the neural population, must be preserved across time. We recorded from populations of neurons in premotor, primary motor and somatosensory cortices as monkeys performed a reaching task, for up to 2 years. Intriguingly, despite a steady turnover in the recorded neurons, the low-dimensional latent dynamics remained stable. The stability allowed reliable decoding of behavioral features for the entire timespan, while fixed decoders based directly on the recorded neural activity degraded substantially. We posit that stable latent cortical dynamics within the manifold are the fundamental building blocks underlying consistent behavioral execution.},

As such, the literature has evolved somewhat ad-hocly, with different model classes being developed to tackle specific situations. This article is an attempt to summarize the current state of count time series modeling. The article first reviews models having prescribed marginal distributions, including some recent developments. This is followed by a discussion of state-space approaches. Multivariate extensions of the methods are then studied and Bayesian approaches to the problem are considered.

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the Bayesian posterior mean estimates (or Bayes’ estimate) of the parameter set of Poisson hidden Markov models in which the observation sequence is generated by a Poisson distribution whose parameter depends on the underlining discrete-time time-homogeneous Markov chain. Although the most commonly used procedures for obtaining parameter estimates for hidden Markov models are versions of the expectation maximization and Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches, this paper exhibits an algorithm for calculating the exact posterior mean estimates which, although still cumbersome, has polynomial rather than exponential complexity, and is a feasible alternative for use with small scale models and data sets. This paper also shows simulation results, comparing the posterior mean estimates obtained by this algorithm and the maximum likelihood estimates obtained by expectation maximization approach.},

	abstract = {The production of legislative acts is affected by multiple sources of latent heterogeneity, due to multilevel and multivariate unobserved factors that operate in conjunction with observed covariates at all the levels of the data hierarchy. We account for these factors by estimating a multilevel Poisson regression model for repeated measurements of bivariate counts of executive and ordinary legislative acts, enacted under multiple Italian governments, nested within legislatures. The model integrates discrete bivariate random effects at the legislature level and Markovian sequences of discrete bivariate random effects at the government level. It can be estimated by a computationally feasible expectation-maximization algorithm. It naturally extends a traditional Poisson regression model to allow for multiple outcomes, longitudinal dependence and multilevel data hierarchy. The model is exploited to detect multiple cycles of legislative supply that arise at multiple timescales in a case-study of Italian legislative production.},

	abstract = {The deterioration of a pavement surface can be described in terms of the presence and severity of distinct distresses, like potholes, cracking, and rutting. Each deterioration process is ordinarily described by a set of pavement indicators (e.g., number of potholes, percentage of cracks, international roughness index) that are measured during monitoring and inspection activities. Manifestly, there exist statistical correlations among the deterioration processes. For instance, cracks appearing on a road section may contribute to an increase in pothole occurrence, and vice versa. In order to mathematically formulate the statistical interdependency among deterioration processes, a Poisson hidden Markov model is proposed in this paper. The model describes the complex process of pavement deterioration, which includes the frequent occurrence of local damage (e.g., potholes) as well as the degradation of other pavement indicators (e.g., cracks, roughness). To model the concurrent frequency of local damage, a stochastic Poisson process is used. At the same time, a Markov chain model is used to depict the degradation of other pavement indicators. A numerical estimation approach using Bayesian statistics with a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation is developed to derive the values of the model’s parameters based on historical information. The applicability of the model was demonstrated through an empirical example using data from a Japanese highway road link.},

We propose a method for estimating the model parameters in long MVC sequences. We then present extensive numerical simulations assessing the model's ability to produce traffic with realistic characteristics for a general class of MVC sequences. We then extend our framework to network applications where we show that our model is able to accurately describe the sender and receiver buffers behavior in MVC transmission. Finally, we derive a model of user behavior for interactive view selection, which, in conjunction with our traffic model, is able to accurately predict actual network load in interactive multiview services.},

	abstract = {Poisson Hidden Markov models (PHMMs) are introduced to model temporal seismicity changes. In a PHMM the unobserved sequence of states is a finite-state Markov chain and the distribution of the observation at any time is Poisson with rate depending only on the current state of the chain. Thus, PHMMs allow a region to have varying seismicity rate. We applied the PHMM to model earthquake frequencies in the seismogenic area of Killini, Ionian Sea, Greece, between period 1990 and 2006. Simulations of data from the assumed model showed that it describes quite well the true data. The earthquake catalogue is dominated by main shocks occurring in 1993, 1997 and 2002. The time plot of PHMM seismicity states not only reproduces the three seismicity clusters but also quantifies the seismicity level and underlies the degree of strength of the serial dependence of the events at any point of time. Foreshock activity becomes quite evident before the three sequences with the gradual transition to states of cascade seismicity. Traditional analysis, based on the determination of highly significant changes of seismicity rates, failed to recognize foreshocks before the 1997 main shock due to the low number of events preceding that main shock. Then, PHMM has better performance than traditional analysis since the transition from one state to another does not only depend on the total number of events involved but also on the current state of the system. Therefore, PHMM recognizes significant changes of seismicity soon after they start, which is of particular importance for real-time recognition of foreshock activities and other seismicity changes.},

These methods were applied to the data on Vibrio cholerae counts reported every month for 11-year span at Christian Medical College, Vellore, India. Using Viterbi algorithm, the best estimate of the state sequence was obtained and hence the transition probability matrix. The mean passage time between the states were estimated. The 95\% confidence interval for the mean passage time was estimated via Monte Carlo simulation. The three hidden states of the estimated Markov chain are labelled as ?Low?, ?Moderate? and ?High? with the mean counts of 1.4, 6.6 and 20.2 and the estimated average duration of stay of 3, 3 and 4 months, respectively.

We aim to contribute to this framework by extending the well known class of univariate hidden Markov models to the multidimensional case, by introducing multivariate Poisson hidden Markov models. Each state of the extended model is associated with a different multivariate discrete distribution. We consider different distributions with Poisson marginals, starting from the multivariate Poisson distribution and then extending to copula based distributions to allow flexible dependence structures. An EM type algorithm is developed for maximum likelihood estimation. A real data application is presented to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed models. In particular, we apply the models to the occurrence of strong earthquakes (surface wave magnitude ≥5), in three seismogenic subregions in the broad region of the North Aegean Sea for the time period from 1 January 1981 to 31 December 2008. Earthquakes occurring in one subregion may trigger events in adjacent ones and hence the observed time series of events are cross-correlated. It is evident from the results that the three subregions interact with each other at times differing by up to a few months. This migration of seismic activity is captured by the model as a transition to a state of higher seismicity.},

	abstract = {Cognitive radio networks can be designed to manage the radio spectrum more efficiently by utilizing the spectrum holes in primary users' licensed frequency bands. Recent studies have shown that the radio spectrum is poorly utilized by the licensed users even in urban geographical areas. This spectrum utilization can be improved significantly by making it possible for secondary users (who are not being served by the primary system) to access spectrum holes, i.e., frequency bands not used by licensed users. In this novel work, we use hidden Markov models (HMMs) to model and predict the spectrum occupancy of licensed radio bands. The proposed technique can dynamically select different licensed bands for its own use with significantly less interference from and to the licensed users. It is found that by predicting the duration of spectrum holes of primary users, the CR can utilize them more efficiently by leaving the band, that it currently occupies, before the start of traffic from the primary user of that band. We propose a simple algorithm, called the Markov-based channel prediction algorithm (MCPA), for dynamic spectrum allocation in cognitive radio networks. In this work, we present the performance of our proposed dynamic spectrum allocation algorithm when the channel state occupancy of primary users are assumed to be Poisson distributed. The impact of CR transmission on the licensed users is also presented. It is shown that significant SIR improvements can be achieved using HMM based dynamic spectrum allocation as compared to the traditional CSMA based approach. The results obtained using HMM are very promising and HMM can offer a new paradigm for predicting channel behavior in cognitive radio, an area that has been of much research interest lately.},

	abstract = {Surveillance data for communicable nosocomial pathogens usually consist of short time series of low‐numbered counts of infected patients. These often show overdispersion and autocorrelation. To date, almost all analyses of such data have ignored the communicable nature of the organisms and have used methods appropriate only for independent outcomes. Inferences that depend on such analyses cannot be considered reliable when patient‐to‐patient transmission is important.  We propose a new method for analysing these data based on a mechanistic model of the epidemic process. Since important nosocomial pathogens are often carried asymptomatically with overt infection developing in only a proportion of patients, the epidemic process is usually only partially observed by routine surveillance data. We therefore develop a ‘structured’ hidden Markov model where the underlying Markov chain is generated by a simple transmission model.  We apply both structured and standard (unstructured) hidden Markov models to time series for three important pathogens. We find that both methods can offer marked improvements over currently used approaches when nosocomial spread is important. Compared to the standard hidden Markov model, the new approach is more parsimonious, is more biologically plausible, and allows key epidemiological parameters to be estimated.},

This situation occurs commonly in many domains of application, particularly in disease mapping. We assume that the counts follow a Poisson model at the lowest level of the hierarchy, and introduce a finite-mixture model for the Poisson rates at the next level. The novelty lies in the model for allocation to the mixture components, which follows a spatially correlated process, the Potts model, and in treating the number of components of the spatial mixture as unknown. Inference is performed in a Bayesian framework using reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo. The model introduced can be viewed as a Bayesian semiparametric approach to specifying flexible spatial distribution in hierarchical models. Performance of the model and comparison with an alternative well-known Markov random field specification for the Poisson rates are demonstrated on synthetic datasets. We show that our allocation model avoids the problem of oversmoothing in cases where the underlying rates exhibit discontinuities, while giving equally good results in cases of smooth gradient-like or highly autocorrelated rates. The methodology is illustrated on an epidemiologic application to data on a rare cancer in France.},

In this paper, we apply Poisson hidden Markov models (PHMM) using the January 1, 1960 to January 20, 2019 earthquake data of Metro Manila, Philippines. The parameters in the models are estimated using expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We determine using various statistical tests that the 5-state PHMM best represents the earthquake data and implement bootstrap algorithm to validate the acceptability of its parameter estimates. Moreover, we investigate the forecasting capability of the 5-state PHMM by comparing it to the ARIMA model. Using unscaled mean bounded relative absolute error (UMBRAE), we find that the 5-state PHMM gives closer one-step ahead forecasts and is a better forecasting model for the considered data.},

	abstract = {In mechanical ventilation, it is paramount to ensure the patient’s ventilatory demand is met while minimizing asynchronies. We aimed to develop a model to predict the likelihood of asynchronies occurring. We analyzed 10,409,357 breaths from 51 critically ill patients who underwent mechanical ventilation {\textgreater}24 h. Patients were continuously monitored and common asynchronies were identified and regularly indexed. Based on discrete time-series data representing the total count of asynchronies, we defined four states or levels of risk of asynchronies, z1 (very-low-risk) – z4 (very-high-risk). A Poisson hidden Markov model was used to predict the probability of each level of risk occurring in the next period. Long periods with very few asynchronous events, and consequently very-low-risk, were more likely than periods with many events (state z4). States were persistent; large shifts of states were uncommon and most switches were to neighbouring states. Thus, patients entering states with a high number of asynchronies were very likely to continue in that state, which may have serious implications. This novel approach to dealing with patient-ventilator asynchrony is a first step in developing smart alarms to alert professionals to patients entering high-risk states so they can consider actions to improve patient-ventilator interaction.},

	abstract = {Background \& Aim: Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is one of the most common endocrine diseases and is a major cause of preventable mental retardation. Early diagnosis of CH can help prevent future diseases. Although time series techniques are often utilized to forecast future status, they are inadequate to deal with count data with overdispersion. The aim of this study was to apply Poisson hidden Markov model to forecast new monthly cases of CH disease.Methods \& Materials: This study was based on the monthly frequency of new CH cases in Khuzestan province of Iran, from 2008 to 2014. We applied stationary Poisson hidden Markov with different states to determine the number of states for the model. According to the model, with the specified state, new CH cases were forecast for the next 24 months. Results: The Poisson hidden Markov with two states based on Akaike information criterion was chosen for the data. The results of forecasting showed that the new CH cases for the next 2 years comforted in state two with the frequency of new cases at 6-18. The forecast mode and median for all months were 12 and 13, respectively. Each state is explained by each component of dependent mixture model. Conclusion: Our estimates indicated that state of frequency of CH case is invariant during the forecast time. Forecast means for the next 2 years were from 13 to 14 new CH cases. Furthermore, forecasting intervals were observed between 7 and 25 new cases. These estimates are valid when the general fertility rate and crude birth rate were been fixed.},

Here, we apply hidden Markov models (HMMs) to characterize blue whale movement and diving behaviour, identifying latent states corresponding to three main underlying behaviour states: shallow feeding, travelling, and deep feeding. The model formulation accounts for inter-whale differences via a computationally efficient discrete random effect, and measures potential effects of experimental acoustic disturbance on between-state transition probabilities. We identify clear differences in blue whale disturbance response depending on the behavioural context during exposure, with whales less likely to initiate deep foraging behaviour during exposure. Findings are consistent with earlier studies using smaller samples, but the HMM approach provides a more nuanced characterization of behaviour changes.},

This HMM can simultaneously estimate both the expected lengths of each animal’s display bouts and their within-bout display rates. We highlight the HMM’s ability to estimate changes in animals’ display effort over time and across different social contexts, using data from male greater sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). Male display effort was modeled across three sites in two experimental treatments (robotic female simulating interested or uninterested behavior) and in the presence or absence of live females. Across contexts, we show that sage grouse males primarily adjust their bout lengths rather than their within-bout display rates. Males’ responses to female behavior were correlated with male mating success: males with more matings showed high display persistence regardless of female behavior, while males with fewer matings tended to invest selectively in females that were already showing interest in mating. Additionally, males with higher mating success responded more to the presence of a female than males with fewer matings did. We conclude with suggestions for adapting our HMM approach for use in other animal systems.},

In this article, we introduce a framework of models for the early detection of the onset of an influenza epidemic which is applicable to different kinds of surveillance data. In particular, the process of the observed cases is modelled via a Bayesian Hierarchical Poisson model in which the intensity parameter is a function of the incidence rate. The key point is to consider this incidence rate as a normal distribution in which both parameters (mean and variance) are modelled differently, depending on whether the system is in an epidemic or non-epidemic phase. To do so, we propose a hidden Markov model in which the transition between both phases is modelled as a function of the epidemic state of the previous week. Different options for modelling the rates are described, including the option of modelling the mean at each phase as autoregressive processes of order 0, 1 or 2. Bayesian inference is carried out to provide the probability of being in an epidemic state at any given moment. The methodology is applied to various influenza data sets. The results indicate that our methods outperform previous approaches in terms of sensitivity, specificity and timeliness.},

	abstract = {Background. Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic psychiatric condition characterized by large episodic changes in mood and energy. Recently, BD has been proposed to be conceptualized as chronic cyclical mood instability, as opposed to the traditional view of alternating discrete episodes with stable periods in-between. Recognizing this mood instability may improve care and calls for high-frequency measures coupled with advanced statistical models. 
Methods. To uncover empirically derived mood states, a multilevel hidden Markov model (HMM) was applied to 4-month ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data in twenty patients with BD, yielding {\textasciitilde}9.820 assessments in total. EMA data comprised self-report questionnaires (5x daily) measuring manic and depressive constructs. Manic and depressive symptoms were also assessed weekly using the Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale and the Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report. Alignment between HMM-uncovered momentary mood states and weekly questionnaires was assessed with a multilevel linear model.
Results. HMM uncovered four mood states (euthymic, manic, mixed, and depressive) that aligned with weekly symptom scores. Mood states switched more frequently than weekly data suggested. On average, patients remained {\textless}24h in one state: average state duration was 17.1h (SD=78.0) for euthymic, 16.3h (SD=70.8) for depressive, 9.1h (SD=11.6) for manic, and 8.8h (SD=10.9) for mixed. In almost half of the patients, significant mood instability was observed. State duration and switching varied strongly between individuals.
Conclusions. The results indicate that chronic mood instability is a key feature of BD, even in “relatively” euthymic periods. This should be considered in theoretical and clinical conceptualizations of the disorder.},

The MHMM quantifies information on the latent dynamics of behavior over time. In addition, heterogeneity between individuals is accommodated with the inclusion of individual-specific random effects, facilitating the study of individual differences in dynamics. However, the performance of the MHMM has not been sufficiently explored. We performed an extensive simulation to assess the effect of the number of dependent variables (1–8), number of individuals (5–90), and number of observations per individual (100–1600) on the estimation performance of a Bayesian MHMM with categorical data including various levels of state distinctiveness and separation. We found that using multivariate data generally alleviates the sample size needed and improves the stability of the results. Moreover, including variables only consisting of random noise was generally not detrimental to model performance. Regarding the estimation of group-level parameters, the number of individuals and observations largely compensate for each other. However, only the former drives the estimation of between-individual variability.

	doi = {10.1016/j.jadr.2023.100635},
	abstract = {Background
Previous human ethology studies have demonstrated that the interpersonal interactions displayed in therapy by both patients and therapists influences a patient's depression improvement. Pairing novel statistical techniques such as the hidden Markov model (HMM), interpersonal interaction dynamics can be uncovered by partitioning time into empirically-derived nonverbal behavioral states. This approach allows for better patient-therapist behavioral dynamics distinctions in predicting depression improvement and, subsequently, for the processes behind depression improvement.
Methods
For the 39 participating patients, the first 15 min of the first or second therapy session was recorded on video to examine the interpersonal interaction behaviors of patients and therapists. The video recordings were encoded for vocalization, looking and leg movement behavior events at a 1 s frequency. A Bayesian multivariate multilevel HMM was fitted on the behavioral event data.
Results
It is demonstrated that patients that show improvement in the depression score are characterized by interpersonal interaction dynamics of hyperfocus when listening to their therapist in psychotherapy when compared to non-improving patients. The data supports evidence for the emergence of differences in interpersonal interaction dynamics through changed durations of the patient hyper focused listening states, but not through changed state-switching dynamics over time.
Limitations
Due to our relatively small sample size we could not fit multilevel HMMs composed of more than three hidden states.
Conclusions
We suggest that applying HMMs will aid human ethological behavior studies in uncovering interpersonal interaction dynamics that occur in therapy and be able to use these dynamics to predict patient depression symptom improvement.},

We used SEM, in vivo neural recordings, and histology (GFAP, Iba-1, NeuN). Three MEAs that were never implanted were also imaged as controls. Main results. SEM revealed progressive corrosion of the platinum electrode tips and changes to the underlying silicon. The parylene insulation was prone to cracking and delamination, and in some instances the silicone elastomer also delaminated from the edges of the MEA. Substantial tissue encapsulation was observed and was often seen growing into defects in the platinum and parylene. These material defects became more common as the time in vivo increased. Histology at 37 and 1051 days post-implant showed gliosis, disruption of normal cortical architecture with minimal neuronal loss, and high Iba-1 reactivity, especially within the arachnoid and dura. Electrode tracts were either absent or barely visible in the cortex at 1051 days, but were seen in the fibrotic encapsulation material suggesting that the MEAs were lifted out of the brain. Neural recordings showed a progressive drop in impedance, signal amplitude, and viable channels over time. Significance. These results provide evidence that signal loss in MEAs is truly multifactorial. Gliosis occurs in the first few months after implantation but does not prevent useful recordings for several years. Progressive meningeal fibrosis encapsulates and lifts MEAs out of the cortex while ongoing foreign body reactions lead to progressive degradation of the materials. Long-term impedance drops are due to the corrosion of platinum, cracking and delamination of parylene, and delamination of silicone elastomer. Oxygen radicals released by cells of the immune system likely mediate the degradation of these materials. Future MEA designs must address these problems through more durable insulation materials, more inert electrode alloys, and pharmacologic suppression of fibroblasts and leukocytes.},

	abstract = {Objective. Carbon fiber electrodes may enable better long-term brain implants, minimizing the tissue response commonly seen with silicon-based electrodes. The small diameter fiber may enable high-channel count brain-machine interfaces capable of reproducing dexterous movements. Past carbon fiber electrodes exhibited both high fidelity single unit recordings and a healthy neuronal population immediately adjacent to the recording site. However, the recording yield of our carbon fiber arrays chronically implanted in the brain typically hovered around 30\%, for previously unknown reasons. In this paper we investigated fabrication process modifications aimed at increasing recording yield and longevity. Approach. We tested a new cutting method using a 532nm laser against traditional scissor methods for the creation of the electrode recording site. We verified the efficacy of improved recording sites with impedance measurements and in vivo array recording yield. Additionally, we tested potentially longer-lasting coating alternatives to PEDOT:pTS, including PtIr and oxygen plasma etching. New coatings were evaluated with accelerated soak testing and acute recording. Main results. We found that the laser created a consistent, sustainable 257 ± 13.8 µm2 electrode with low 1 kHz impedance (19 ± 4 kΩ with PEDOT:pTS) and low fiber-to-fiber variability. The PEDOT:pTS coated laser cut fibers were found to have high recording yield in acute (97\% {\textgreater} 100 µVpp, N = 34 fibers) and chronic (84\% {\textgreater} 100 µVpp, day 7; 71\% {\textgreater} 100 µVpp, day 63, N = 45 fibers) settings. The laser cut recording sites were good platforms for the PtIr coating and oxygen plasma etching, slowing the increase in 1 kHz impedance compared to PEDOT:pTS in an accelerated soak test. Significance. We have found that laser cut carbon fibers have a high recording yield that can be maintained for over two months in vivo and that alternative coatings perform better than PEDOT:pTS in accelerated aging tests. This work provides evidence to support carbon fiber arrays as a viable approach to high-density, clinically-feasible brain-machine interfaces.},

	abstract = {Animal tracking and biologging devices record large amounts of data on individual movement behaviors in natural environments. In these data, movement ecologists often view unexplained variation around the mean as “noise” when studying patterns at the population level. In the field of behavioral ecology, however, focus has shifted from population means to the biological underpinnings of variation around means. Specifically, behavioral ecologists use repeated measures of individual behavior to partition behavioral variability into intrinsic among-individual variation and reversible behavioral plasticity and to quantify: a) individual variation in behavioral types (i.e. different average behavioral expression), b) individual variation in behavioral plasticity (i.e. different responsiveness of individuals to environmental gradients), c) individual variation in behavioral predictability (i.e. different residual within-individual variability of behavior around the mean), and d) correlations among these components and correlations in suites of behaviors, called ‘behavioral syndromes’. We here suggest that partitioning behavioral variability in animal movements will further the integration of movement ecology with other fields of behavioral ecology. We provide a literature review illustrating that individual differences in movement behaviors are insightful for wildlife and conservation studies and give recommendations regarding the data required for addressing such questions. In the accompanying R tutorial we provide a guide to the statistical approaches quantifying the different aspects of among-individual variation. We use movement data from 35 African elephants and show that elephants differ in a) their average behavior for three common movement behaviors, b) the rate at which they adjusted movement over a temporal gradient, and c) their behavioral predictability (ranging from more to less predictable individuals). Finally, two of the three movement behaviors were correlated into a behavioral syndrome (d), with farther moving individuals having shorter mean residence times. Though not explicitly tested here, individual differences in movement and predictability can affect an individual’s risk to be hunted or poached and could therefore open new avenues for conservation biologists to assess population viability. We hope that this review, tutorial, and worked example will encourage movement ecologists to examine the biology of individual variation in animal movements hidden behind the population mean.},

	abstract = {Temperament describes the idea that individual behavioural differences are repeatable over time and across situations. This common phenomenon covers numerous traits, such as aggressiveness, avoidance of novelty, willingness to take risks, exploration, and sociality. The study of temperament is central to animal psychology, behavioural genetics, pharmacology, and animal husbandry, but relatively few studies have examined the ecology and evolution of temperament traits. This situation is surprising, given that temperament is likely to exert an important influence on many aspects of animal ecology and evolution, and that individual variation in temperament appears to be pervasive amongst animal species. Possible explanations for this neglect of temperament include a perceived irrelevance, an insufficient understanding of the link between temperament traits and fitness, and a lack of coherence in terminology with similar traits often given different names, or different traits given the same name. We propose that temperament can and should be studied within an evolutionary ecology framework and provide a terminology that could be used as a working tool for ecological studies of temperament. Our terminology includes five major temperament trait categories: shyness-boldness, exploration-avoidance, activity, sociability and aggressiveness. This terminology does not make inferences regarding underlying dispositions or psychological processes, which may have restrained ecologists and evolutionary biologists from working on these traits. We present extensive literature reviews that demonstrate that temperament traits are heritable, and linked to fitness and to several other traits of importance to ecology and evolution. Furthermore, we describe ecologically relevant measurement methods and point to several ecological and evolutionary topics that would benefit from considering temperament, such as phenotypic plasticity, conservation biology, population sampling, and invasion biology.},

Noting that systems usually exhibit multiple states and that the actual state of a system usually is not directly observable, in the method we first model the system degradation process and the observation process based on a hidden Markov model. Then we develop a sequential Bayesian inference algorithm based on importance sampling and the forward algorithm to infer the posterior distributions of the transition rates in the hidden Markov model based on available observations. The proposed Bayesian method allows us to take advantage of evidence from multiple sources, and also allows us to perform Bayesian inference sequentially, without the need to use the entire history of observations every time new observations are collected. We demonstrate the proposed method using both synthetic data for a nuclear power plant feedwater pump and realistic data for a nuclear power plant chemistry analytical device.},

	abstract = {Background
Alterations and instability in mood and activity/energy has been associated with impaired functioning and risk of relapse in bipolar disorder. The present study aimed to investigate whether mood instability and activity/energy instability are associated, and whether these instability measures are associated with stress, quality of life and functioning in patients with bipolar disorder.
Methods
Data from two studies were combined for exploratory post hoc analyses. Patients with bipolar disorder provided smartphone-based evaluations of mood and activity/energy levels from day-to-day. In addition, information on functioning, perceived stress and quality of life was collected. A total of 316 patients with bipolar disorder were included.
Results
A total of 55,968 observations of patient-reported smartphone-based data collected from day-to-day were available. Regardless of the affective state, there was a statistically significant positive association between mood instability and activity/energy instability in all models (all p-values {\textless} 0.0001). There was a statistically significant association between mood and activity/energy instability with patient-reported stress and quality of life (e.g., mood instability and stress: B: 0.098, 95 \% CI: 0.085; 0.11, p {\textless} 0.0001), and between mood instability and functioning (B: 0.045, 95 \% CI: 0.0011; 0.0080, p = 0.010).
Limitations
Findings should be interpreted with caution since the analyses were exploratory and post hoc by nature.
Conclusion
Mood instability and activity/energy instability is suggested to play important roles in the symptomatology of bipolar disorder. This highlight that monitoring and identifying subsyndromal inter-episodic fluctuations in symptoms is clinically recommended. Future studies investigating the effect of treatment on these measures would be interesting.},

	abstract = {Objectives
To investigate whether mood instability (MI) qualify as a trait marker for bipolar disorder (BD) we investigated: 1) differences in smartphone-based self-reported MI between three groups: patients with newly diagnosed BD, unaffected first-degree relatives (UR), and healthy control individuals (HC); 2) the correlation between MI and functioning, stress, and duration of illness, respectively; and 3) the validity of smartphone-based self-evaluated mood ratings as compared to observer-based ratings of depressed and manic mood.
Methods
203 patients with newly diagnosed BD, 54 UR and 109 HC were included as part of the longitudinal Bipolar Illness Onset study. Participants completed daily smartphone-based mood ratings for a period of up to two years and were clinically assessed with ratings of depression, mania and functioning.
Results
Mood instability scores were statistically significantly higher in patients with BD compared with HC (mean=1.18, 95\%CI: 1.12;1.24 vs 1.05, 95\%CI: 0.98;1.13, p = 0.007) and did not differ between patients with BD and UR (mean=1.17, 95\%CI: 1.07;1.28, p = 0.91). For patients, increased MI scores correlated positively with impaired functioning (p{\textless}0.001), increased stress level (p{\textless}0.001) and increasing number of prior mood episodes (p{\textless}0.001). Smartphone-based mood ratings correlated with ratings of mood according to sub-item 1 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17-items and the Young Mania Rating Scale, respectively (p´s{\textless}0.001).
Limitation
The study had a smaller number of UR than planned.
Conclusion
Mood instability is increased in patients with newly diagnosed BD and unaffected relatives and associated with decreased functioning. The findings highlight MI as a potential trait marker for BD.},

They provide more reliable causal estimates than conventional two-way fixed effects models when treatment effects are heterogeneous or unobserved time-varying confounders exist. Moreover, we propose a new dynamic treatment effects plot, along with several diagnostic tests, to help researchers gauge the validity of the identifying assumptions.

	abstract = {Propensity score analysis is often used to address selection bias in program evaluation with observational data. However, a recent study suggested that propensity score matching may accomplish the opposite of its intended goal—increasing imbalance, inefficiency, model dependence, and bias. We assess common propensity score models and offer our responses to these criticisms. We used Monte Carlo methods to simulate two alternative settings of data creation—selection on observed variables versus selection on unobserved variables—and compared eight propensity score models on bias reduction and sample-size retention. Based on the simulations, no single propensity score method reduced bias across all scenarios. Optimal results depend on the fit between assumptions embedded in the analytic model and the process of data generation. Methodologic knowledge of model assumptions and substantive knowledge of causal mechanisms, including sources of selection bias, should inform the choice of analytic strategies involving propensity scores.},

	abstract = {We show that propensity score matching (PSM), an enormously popular method of preprocessing data for causal inference, often accomplishes the opposite of its intended goal—thus increasing imbalance, inefficiency, model dependence, and bias. The weakness of PSM comes from its attempts to approximate a completely randomized experiment, rather than, as with other matching methods, a more efficient fully blocked randomized experiment. PSM is thus uniquely blind to the often large portion of imbalance that can be eliminated by approximating full blocking with other matching methods. Moreover, in data balanced enough to approximate complete randomization, either to begin with or after pruning some observations, PSM approximates random matching which, we show, increases imbalance even relative to the original data. Although these results suggest researchers replace PSM with one of the other available matching methods, propensity scores have other productive uses.},

The short-run motive is to get patents, and the long-run motive is to influence income growth of the countries. The empirical findings so far are skeptical on the effects of research and development (R\&D) spending. The present study further investigates the long-run associations and short-run dynamics among R\&D spending, number of patents and per capita income growth in the panel of countries and groups for the period 1996–2017. Using VAR model for the panel data, the study observes that R\&D spending, number of patents and per capita income growth have no long-run equilibrium relations but in the short-run, income growth and number of patents make a cause to R\&D spending. However, there are weak causation from patents and R\&D spending to income growth rates. The study thus recommends for controlling unfair competition on spending on R\&D head and getting patents since it increases the magnitudes of social cost.},

Within this context, the purpose of this study is to evaluate whether or not the economic growth performances of OECD-20 and OECD-9 countries have a sustainable structure that endogenizes the technological advancements and occurs by the increments in average factor productivity. At the end of the paper it is determined that all the R\&amp;D variables in different qualifications of the OECD-20 group have a higher income level in sample period and have positive and statistically significant effects on the economic growth. On the other hand, only the private sector, universities and the total R\&amp;D investments have positive and statistically significant effects on the economic growth of the OECD-9 group which has comparatively lower income level. However, it is specified that the size of the positive and statistically significant effects of the R\&amp;D investment variables in different qualifications is more than two times bigger in the OECD-20 group as opposed to the OECD-9 group.},

Further, per capita GDP growth is the cause of R\&D for OECD, upper-middle-, and low- and middle-income groups along with Japan, and R\&D is the cause to per capita GDP for India, Russia, and Brazil. Finally, there is bilateral causality between the two for USA, China, and South Korea. Interestingly, there are no true long-run associations between R\&D and per capita GDP, although some short-run interplays are there.

This systematization opens the door to precise quantitative inference in small-sample comparative studies, without precluding the application of qualitative approaches.

They are based on the estimates of the conditional probabilities of emitting a missing data given the latent state of the Markov chain and some observed covariables. When the ignorable mechanism holds, the conditional probabilities of emitting a missing value are the same for a given value of the observed variables. On the contrary, when the MCAR mechanism holds, these probabilities are all the same. A practical implementation of these tests based on simulations is proposed, along with a presentation of their performances. A real example from piglet farming illustrates their use.},

When missingness depends on time but not the hidden states, a model which only allows for state-dependent missingness is biased, whilst a model that allows for both state- and time-dependent missingness is not. Overall, these results show that modelling missingness as state-dependent, and including other relevant covariates, is a useful strategy in applications of hidden Markov models to time-series with missing data.

The missing-at-random (MAR) assumption is formulated to deal with the first two types of missingness, while to account for the informative dropout, we rely on an extra absorbing state. Estimation of the model parameters is based on the maximum likelihood method that is implemented by an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm relying on suitable recursions. The proposal is illustrated by a Monte Carlo simulation study and an application based on historical data on primary biliary cholangitis.},

	abstract = {Affect is central to human functioning. Due to its dynamic nature, it is often studied with intensive longitudinal designs, yet the development and validation of measures for this purpose have received little systematic attention. In the present study, we review theoretical and methodological conceptualizations of affect that are relevant for repeated momentary positive and negative affect measurement. We developed a questionnaire including six dimensional affect and 22 discrete emotion items that allowed us to measure alternative momentary affect constructs with single- and multi-item scores. The items were operationalized into two bipolar, six positive, and six negative momentary affect measures. We compared the measures with three quantifiable criteria of construct validity: the amount of within-person variance, within-person sensitivity to emotional events, and between-person relations to depression and neuroticism. The criteria were empirically investigated with a preregistered experience sampling study (N = 153). We identify the measures with the strongest validity evidence across all criteria and evaluate their suitability for specific research questions, by looking at individual criteria. The overall findings provide strong evidence supporting the use of single-item measures of momentary affect. Furthermore, single items provide an efficient low-burden assessment tool that is comparable across studies. For multi-item scales, it is recommended to combine discrete emotion items of similar intensity, while simply selecting and averaging discrete emotion items is problematic concerning our validity criteria. In the future, we encourage the field to conduct systematic research on the use and interpretation of scores that aggregate different emotion items together.

Because methodological guidance on assessing and reporting reliability at multiple levels of analysis is currently lacking, we discuss the importance of examining level-specific reliability. We present a simulation study and an applied example showing different methods for estimating multilevel reliability using multilevel confirmatory factor analysis and provide supporting Mplus program code. We conclude that (a) single-level estimates will not reflect a scale's actual reliability unless reliability is identical at each level of analysis, (b) 2-level alpha and composite reliability (omega) perform relatively well in most settings, (c) estimates of maximal reliability (H) were more biased when estimated using multilevel data than either alpha or omega, and (d) small cluster size can lead to overestimates of reliability at the between level of analysis. We also show that Monte Carlo confidence intervals and Bayesian credible intervals closely reflect the sampling distribution of reliability estimates under most conditions. We discuss the estimation of credible intervals using Mplus and provide R code for computing Monte Carlo confidence intervals.},

	abstract = {The study of functional brain networks has grown rapidly over the past decade. While most functional connectivity (FC) analyses estimate one static network structure for the entire length of the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series, recently there has been increased interest in studying time-varying changes in FC. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have proven to be a useful modeling approach for discovering repeating graphs of interacting brain regions (brain states). However, a limitation lies in HMMs assuming that the sojourn time, the number of consecutive time points in a state, is geometrically distributed. This may encourage inaccurate estimation of the time spent in a state before switching to another state. We propose a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) approach for inferring time-varying brain networks from fMRI data, which explicitly models the sojourn distribution. Specifically, we propose using HSMMs to find each subject’s most probable series of network states and the graphs associated with each state, while properly estimating and modeling the sojourn distribution for each state. We perform a simulation study, as well as an analysis on both task-based fMRI data from an anxiety-inducing experiment and resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project. Our results demonstrate the importance of model choice when estimating sojourn times and reveal their potential for understanding healthy and diseased brain mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The covariance matrix plays an important role in statistical inference, yet modeling a covariance matrix is often a difficult task in practice due to its dimensionality and the non-negative definite constraint. In order to model a covariance matrix effectively, it is typically broken down into components based on modeling considerations or mathematical convenience. Decompositions that have received recent research attention include variance components, spectral decomposition, Cholesky decomposition, and matrix logarithm. In this paper we study a statistically motivated decomposition which appears to be relatively unexplored for the purpose of modeling. We model a covariance matrix in terms of its corresponding standard deviations and correlation matrix. We discuss two general modeling situations where this approach is useful: shrinkage estimation of regression coefficients, and a general location-scale model for both categorical and continuous variables. We present some simple choices for priors in terms of standard deviations and the correlation matrix, and describe a straightforward computational strategy for obtaining the posterior of the covariance matrix. We apply our method to real and simulated data sets in the context of shrinkage estimation.},

	abstract = {Classifying movement behaviour of marine predators in relation to anthropogenic activity and environmental conditions is important to guide marine conservation. We studied the relationship between grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) behaviour and environmental variability in the southwestern Baltic Sea where seal-fishery conflicts are increasing. We used multiple environmental covariates and proximity to active fishing nets within a multivariate hidden Markov model (HMM) to quantify changes in movement behaviour of grey seals while at sea. Dive depth, dive duration, surface duration, horizontal displacement, and turning angle were used to identify travelling, resting and foraging states. The likelihood of seals foraging increased in deeper, colder, more saline waters, which are sites with increased primary productivity and possibly prey densities. Proximity to active fishing net also had a pronounced effect on state occupancy. The probability of seals foraging was highest {\textless}5 km from active fishing nets (51\%) and decreased as distance to nets increased. However, seals used sites {\textless}5 km from active fishing nets only 3\% of their time at sea highlighting an important temporal dimension in seal-fishery interactions. By coupling high-resolution oceanographic, fisheries, and grey seal movement data, our study provides a scientific basis for designing management strategies that satisfy ecological and socioeconomic demands on marine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Patterns of habitat use are commonly studied in horizontal space, but this does not capture the four-dimensional nature of ocean habitats (space, depth, and time). Deep-diving marine animals encounter varying oceanographic conditions, particularly at the poles, where there is strong seasonal variation in vertical ocean structuring. This dimension of space use is hidden if we only consider horizontal movement. To identify different diving behaviours and usage patterns of vertically distributed habitat, we use hidden Markov models fitted to telemetry data from an air-breathing top predator, the Weddell seal, in the Weddell Sea, Antarctica. We present evidence of overlapping use of high-density, continental shelf water masses by both sexes, as well as important differences in their preferences for oceanographic conditions. Males spend more time in the unique high-salinity shelf water masses found at depth, while females also venture off the continental shelf and visit warmer, shallower water masses. Both sexes exhibit a diurnal pattern in diving behaviour (deep in the day, shallow at night) that persists from austral autumn into winter. The differences in habitat use in this resident, sexually monomorphic Antarctic top predator suggest a different set of needs and constraints operating at the intraspecific level, not driven by body size.},
